# Serverless Architecture

When you have to deploy Backend Server on the internet, there are a few ways - 
- Go to aws, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare
- Rent a VM (Virtual Machine) and deploy your app
- Put it in an Auto scaling group
- Deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster


There are a few downsides to doing this - 
- Taking care of how/when to scale
- Base cost even if no one is visiting your website
- Monitoring various servers to make sure no server is down


"Serverless" is a backend deployment in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers, developers and operators do not have to worry about the servers.

Serverless, you just write routes and run a command, the app automatically deploy, autoscale, and charge as per request basis.
But problem here is More expensive at scale and cold start problem.

Famous serverless providers example: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Cloudflare Workers.

**Cloudflare workers DONT use the Node.js runtime. They have created their own runtime.**
Under the hood the workers runtime uses V8 engine. Rather than running on the individual's machine, worker functions run on a Cloudflare's Edge Network, a growing global network of thousands of machine distributed accross hundreds of locations.


Though Cloudflare Workers behave similarly to javascript in the browser or in Nodejs, there are a few differences in how you have to think about your code. Under the hood the workers runtime uses the V8 engine - the same engine used by chromium and node js. The workers runtime also implements many of the standard apis available in most modern browsers.

The difference between javascript written for the browser or node js happens at runtime. Rather than running on an individual's machine (for example a browser application or on a centralised server), Workers functions run on Cloudflare's Edge Network - a growing global network of thousands of machines distributed across hundreds of locations.

Each of these machines hosts an instance of the worker's runtime and each of those runtimes is capable of running thousands of user defined applications.



**Initializing a worker**: "npm create cloudflare -- my-app"

```jsx
    import express from "express"
    const app = express();

    app.get("/route", (req, res) => {
        // handles a get request to /route
    });
```
Same thing in cloudflare environment:
```jsx
    export default {
        async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
            console.log(request.body);
            console.log(request.headers);
            
            if (request.method === "GET") {
                return Response.json({
                    message: "you sent a get request"
                });
            } else {
                return Response.json({
                    message: "you did not send a get request"
                });
            }
        },
    };
```




To deploy worker on internet we use wrangler for it.
[Ref](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)

### Wrangler Command Line:
Wrangler the cloudflare developer platform command line interface allow you to manage worker projects.
- Install/Update Wrangler: Get started by installing Wrangler and update to newer version by following this guide.
- API: An experimental API to programmatically manage your Cloudflare workers.
- Bundling: Review Wrangler's default bundling.
- Commands: Create develop and deploy your Cloudflare workers with wrangler commands.
- Configurations: User Wrangler.toml configuration file to customise the development and deployment setup for your worker project and other developer platform products.
- Custom Builds: Customise how your code is compiled, before being processed by Wrangler.
- Deprecations: The difference between Wrangler version, specially deprecated and breaking changes.
- Environments: Deploy the same worker application with different configurations for each environment.
- Migrations: Review migration guides for specific version of Wrangler.
- Run in CI/CD: deploy your workers with a CI/CD environment.
- System Environment Variables: Local environment variables that can change Wrangler's behaviour.

"npx wrangler login"
"npm run deploy"

**Assigning a custom domain**
- You have to buy a plan to be able to do this
- You also need to buy the domain on cloudflare/transfer the domain to cloudflare


It's unlikely you'll see specifically express on workers due to its deep node.js dependencies however there are a lot of options that you'll probably feel right at home with, and have very similar apis to something like Express.
Now, we cant use express in here, as it heavily relies on Node.js. We can use some options in place of express in here:
- honojs/hono
- lukeed/worktop
- kwhitley/itty-router


If we can split our app in small components and we dont need to rely heavily on node.js... Just like this [separate logic](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F085e8ad8-528e-47d7-8922-a23dc4016453%2Fd56c54ff-12ee-4b9e-bda6-699641b27bea%2FScreenshot_2024-02-10_at_4.37.24_AM.jpg?table=block&id=44cd75c5-27b8-4e0b-bf94-d4c1bf546581&cache=v2)

What runtimes does hono supports:
Cloudflare workersjs Cloudflare pages, Dino, Bun, fastly compute, Versal, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, Supabase Functions, Node.js

We use hono as a framework for cloudflare workers
"npm create hono@latest my-app"

```jsx
    import { Hono } from 'hono'

    const app = new Hono()

    app.get('/', async (c) => {
        const body = await c.req.json()
        console.log(body);
        console.log(c.req.header("Authorization"));
        console.log(c.req.query("param"));

        return c.text('Hello Hono!')
    })

    export default app
```

then "npx wrangler login" then "npm run deploy"


To use middleware:
```jsx
    import { Hono, Next } from 'hono'
    import { Context } from 'hono/jsx';

    const app = new Hono()

    app.use(async (c, next) => {
        if (c.req.header("Authorization")) {
            // Do validation
            await next()
        } else {
            return c.text("You dont have acces");
        }
    })

    app.get('/', async (c) => {
        const body = await c.req.parseBody()
        console.log(body);
        console.log(c.req.header("Authorization"));
        console.log(c.req.query("param"));

        return c.json({msg: "as"})
    })

    export default app
```
