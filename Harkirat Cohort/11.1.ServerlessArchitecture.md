# Serverless Architecture

When you need to deploy a backend server on the internet, there are a few approaches:

#### Deployment Options
- Use cloud providers like **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, or **Cloudflare**.
- Rent a **Virtual Machine (VM)** and deploy your app.
- Use an **Auto Scaling Group**.
- Deploy it in a **Kubernetes Cluster**.

#### Downsides of Traditional Deployment
- Managing **how/when to scale**.
- **Base cost** even when no one is visiting your website.
- Monitoring multiple servers to ensure uptime.

---

### What is Serverless?

**Serverless** is a backend deployment approach where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.  
- Developers and operators **do not need to worry about servers**.  
- You just write routes and run a command to deploy your app.  
- Serverless apps **automatically deploy**, **autoscale**, and **charge on a per-request basis**.  

#### Downsides of Serverless
- **More expensive at scale**.
- **Cold start problem** (slower startup times for inactive functions).

#### Famous Serverless Providers
- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions
- Cloudflare Workers

## Cloudflare Workers

- Cloudflare Workers **do not use the Node.js runtime**.  
  They have created their own runtime using **V8 Isolates**.  
- **No Node.js APIs** (e.g., `fs`, `http`, etc.).
- **Lightweight** and optimized for **edge execution**, with better startup times than traditional containerized runtimes.  

### How Cloudflare Workers Work
- The Workers runtime uses the **V8 engine** (also used by Chromium and Node.js).  
- Worker functions run on **Cloudflare's Edge Network**, a global network of thousands of machines distributed across hundreds of locations.

---

### Comparison: AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions

- **Closer to full-fledged Node.js environments**.
- Support Node.js and other popular programming languages.
- Provide richer support for libraries and packages.
- **Higher cold start times** compared to Cloudflare Workers.

---

### Choosing a Backend Approach

### 1. Express with AWS Lambda/Google Cloud Functions
- If you already know **Express**, this is a straightforward choice:
  - **Express Works Out-of-the-Box**: Both AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions support Node.js natively.
  - **Ease of Deployment**: Serverless frameworks like **Serverless Framework**, **AWS SAM**, or **Google Firebase Functions** simplify deployment.
- **Trade-off**:  
  Higher cold start times compared to Cloudflare Workers, especially for larger applications. However, this is acceptable for general-purpose backend services.

---

### 2. Hono with Cloudflare Workers
- If your use case requires **low latency** and **fast startup**, choose Cloudflare Workers with **Hono**:
  - **Ultra-Fast Cold Start Times**: Workers use lightweight V8 isolates instead of containers, making them faster.
  - **Optimized for Edge Deployment**: Best for applications that need to run closer to the user (e.g., global APIs or low-latency services).
  - **Hono is Express-Like**: Offers a familiar API for Express developers.
- **Trade-off**:  
  Cloudflare Workers don’t support all Node.js APIs (e.g., `fs`, `http`), so you might need to adjust your application design.

---

### Cloudflare Workers Runtime

Although Cloudflare Workers behave similarly to JavaScript in the browser or Node.js, there are differences in how they work at runtime:  

- **V8 Engine**: The Workers runtime uses the same engine as Chromium and Node.js.  
- **Global Edge Network**: Worker functions run on Cloudflare's **Edge Network**, a global network of thousands of machines distributed across hundreds of locations.  

#### Key Differences
- Instead of running on an individual's machine (like a browser or centralized server), Workers run on **Cloudflare's distributed Edge Network**.
- Each machine in the network hosts an instance of the Workers runtime, which is capable of running thousands of user-defined applications.


## Cloudflare Workers Deployment and Development

**Initializing a Worker:** 
To create a new Cloudflare worker:

```bash
npm create cloudflare -- my-app
```

#### Example Express App

```jsx
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.get("/route", (req, res) => {
    // Handles a GET request to /route
});
```

#### Same Functionality in Cloudflare Workers

```jsx
export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
        console.log(request.body);
        console.log(request.headers);

        if (request.method === "GET") {
            return Response.json({
                message: "You sent a GET request"
            });
        } else {
            return Response.json({
                message: "You did not send a GET request"
            });
        }
    },
};
```

### Deploying the Worker

To deploy a worker on the internet, you use **Wrangler**:

- [Wrangler Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)

### Wrangler Command Line Interface

Wrangler is the Cloudflare developer platform command line interface (CLI) that allows you to manage worker projects.

- **Install/Update Wrangler**: Get started by installing Wrangler and updating it to newer versions.
- **API**: An experimental API to programmatically manage your Cloudflare workers.
- **Bundling**: Review Wrangler's default bundling.
- **Commands**: Create, develop, and deploy your Cloudflare workers using wrangler commands.
- **Configurations**: Use the `wrangler.toml` configuration file to customize your development and deployment setup.
- **Custom Builds**: Customize how your code is compiled before being processed by Wrangler.
- **Deprecations**: Differences between Wrangler versions, including deprecated and breaking changes.
- **Environments**: Deploy the same worker application with different configurations for each environment.
- **Migrations**: Review migration guides for specific versions of Wrangler.
- **Run in CI/CD**: Deploy your workers in a CI/CD environment.
- **System Environment Variables**: Local environment variables that can change Wrangler's behavior.

### Common Wrangler Commands

1. **Login to Wrangler**:
    ```bash
    npx wrangler login
    ```

2. **Deploy your worker**:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

### Assigning a Custom Domain

- You need to purchase a plan to assign a custom domain.
- You must buy the domain on Cloudflare or transfer it to Cloudflare.

### Alternatives to Express on Cloudflare Workers

It’s unlikely that you'll use **Express** on Cloudflare Workers due to its deep **Node.js** dependencies. However, there are several alternatives that provide similar APIs and are optimized for edge runtimes.

**Alternatives to Express**:
- **honojs/hono**
- **lukeed/worktop**
- **kwhitley/itty-router**

These alternatives are lightweight and designed for edge environments like Cloudflare Workers.

### Splitting Your App into Small Components

If your application can be broken down into smaller components and doesn't rely heavily on Node.js, it makes your app more modular and easier to deploy across distributed environments like Cloudflare Workers.

For example, a modular architecture can be seen here:

### Using Hono with Cloudflare Workers

To use Hono with Cloudflare Workers:

1. **Install Hono**:
    ```bash
    npm create hono@latest my-app
    ```

2. **Example of Hono code**:

```jsx
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

app.get('/', async (c) => {
    const body = await c.req.json();
    console.log(body);
    console.log(c.req.header("Authorization"));
    console.log(c.req.query("param"));

    return c.text('Hello Hono!');
});

export default app;
```

3. **Deploy the worker**:

    - First, login with Wrangler:
    ```bash
    npx wrangler login
    ```

    - Then, deploy:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

### Using Middleware with Hono

To use middleware in Hono:

```jsx
import { Hono, Next } from 'hono';
import { Context } from 'hono/jsx';

const app = new Hono();

app.use(async (c, next) => {
    if (c.req.header("Authorization")) {
        // Do validation
        await next();
    } else {
        return c.text("You don't have access");
    }
});

app.get('/', async (c) => {
    const body = await c.req.parseBody();
    console.log(body);
    console.log(c.req.header("Authorization"));
    console.log(c.req.query("param"));

    return c.json({ msg: "as" });
});

export default app;
```
