# NextJS
- In a React project, you have to maintain a separate Backend project for your API routes
- React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
- React is not SEO Optimised 
- Waterfalling problem


**SEO Optimzation:**
See, How google rank pages is, they have crawlers all around the world that are constantly running, they are hitting more and more websites and trying to figure out what does they do, and rank them.
Now the problem with react websites is, when it hits react websites it gets html css and js files in which they have no reference to the website content. So it doesnt able to figure out what website is this, as the js files runs and put things onto the dom in root div(i.e. the html page content). So, react doesnt give you all the content of the website in the initial html file.


**Waterfalling Problem:**
See how requests goes out, first it hits server for the html file, then it gets reference of js file, then it hits server for the js file, then it hits for the server to get the data because of the fetches in the js. These dont happen parallely they happens one after the other. 
It would be nice if we get all the data in initial html.
The "waterfalling problem" in React, and more broadly in web development, refers to a scenario where data fetching operations are chained or dependent on each other in a way that leads to inefficient loading behavior.


**Next.js offerings:**
- Server side rendering - Get’s rid of SEO problems
- API routes - Single codebase with frontend and backend
- File based routing (no need for react-router-dom)
- Bundle size optimisations, Static site generation

**BUT:**
- Can’t be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does server side rendering and hence is expensive
- Very opinionated, very hard to move out of it

>
If you want your website to be SEO optimized, use NextJS, if not, feel free to use React because NextJS is expensive in terms of hosting.

### Routing in NextJS
Next.js has a file based router. This means that the way you create your files, describes what renders on a route
- Add a new folder in app called signup 
- Add a file called page.tsx inside app/signup
- Whatever you write in this file will be rendered when you hit the /signup route

### layout.tsx
Layouts let you wrap all child pages inside some logic. You can create a layout.tsx file in the app directory, and it will be used to wrap all the pages inside it and its subroutes.
 Eg: appbar/footer, or some common styles that you want to apply to all pages.
In layout file: 
```tsx
    export default function RootLayout({
        children,
    }: ReadOnly<{
        children: React.ReactNode;
    }>) {
        return (
            <html lang="en">
                <body className={inter.className}>
                    hi there
                    {children}
                </body>
            </html>
        )
    }
```
This means every page you render, wrap that page inside this. First html renders, then body renders, then put hi there then children should be rendered.
You have to get the children as props, and then render the children afterwards.

> Whenever you create a new folder with () around the name. This folder is ignored by the router. i.e. this particular thing will be ignored by the router so that the url will be same as the flow of the folder structure but it wont have the name with the () in it.


### Components directory
You should put all your components in a components top level folder directory and use them in the app routes rather than shoving everything in the route handler.
```tsx
    // app/signup/page.tsx
    import { Signin } from "@/components/Signin";

    export default function Signup() {
        return <Signin />
    }
```
Eg: import { Signin as SigninComponent } from "@/components/Signin";


## Use Client
Now try adding a onclick handler to the button. And when you run then it will give error. Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
NextJS expects you to identify all your components as either client or server.
As the name suggests
- Server components are rendered on the server
- Client components are pushed to the client to be rendered
By default, all components are server components.

If you want to mark a component as a client component, you need to add the following to the top of the component - 
"use client"

So to get the onclick handler working, and get the benifits of server side rendering as well then what you can do is:
Make the component that has the onclick handler as a client component, and then use it in the server component.
```tsx
    // app/signup/page.tsx
    import { SigninButton } from "@/components/SigninButton";

    export default function SignupPage() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Sign Up</h1>
                <p>Join us and get started!</p>
                {/* This button is part of the server-rendered HTML */}
                <SigninButton />
            </div>
        );
    }
```
```tsx
    // components/SigninButton.tsx
"use client"  // This marks the component as a client-side component

import { useState } from "react";
import { handleClick } from "@/actions/handleClick"; // Import your action or function

export function SigninButton() {
    const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}> Sign Up </button>
    );
}

```
This way you can have the benefits of server side rendering and also have the client side functionality.

**When should you create client components?**
- Whenever you get an error that tells you that you need to create a client component
- Whenever you’re using something that the server doesn’t understand (useEffect, useState, onClick…)

So making it a client component, then you lose all the SEO capabilities. If you need a client side thing like click handler then you need a client component. 



# Server Side
Next.js is a full stack framework. This means the same process can handle frontend and backend code.

**Advantages?**
- Single codebase for whole application, No need to maintain a separate backend project
- No cors issues, single domain name for your FE and BE
- Ease of deployment, deploy a single codebase


### Data fetching in React
Eg: We get a loader initially and data gets fetched from backend through axios in a useEffect, and then we see the data eventually.
So, you hit url, get index.html then it sees reference for js file then it ask for js file then it hits the endpoint and gets the data, and then it actually renders it.

**We can use async component in React**

In the context of React , an **async component** typically refers to a component that **loads data asynchronously** before rendering or **is loaded asynchronously** (e.g., lazy loading components).

The **asynchronous nature** means the component either:
1. **Waits for some data** or resources (like an API call or file) before rendering, or
2. **Is loaded only when needed** to improve performance (e.g., lazy loading).

An async component usually makes use of JavaScript's **`async`/`await`** syntax to fetch data or load resources before it gets rendered.

In Next.js (and React), you can have two types of async behavior:

* **Server-Side Async Rendering**: Fetch data on the server before rendering (to improve SEO, for example).
* **Client-Side Async Rendering**: Fetch data after the page has loaded in the browser (often for things like dynamic data or interactions that don’t need to be SEO-friendly).

### **Example: Async Component with `Suspense` and `lazy` (for Client-Side Async Components)**

Another use case for **async components** is **lazy loading** components. Here’s how we might **dynamically import a component** only when it’s needed.

#### **Scenario**:

```tsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

// Lazy load a component
const ChartComponent = lazy(() => import('./ChartComponent'));

export default function HomePage() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard</h1>
            {/* Suspense is used to show a fallback (loading state) while the component is being loaded */}
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <ChartComponent />
            </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### **Key Points**:

* **`lazy`**: This function allows you to dynamically import components, and the component will only be loaded when it’s actually required.
* **`Suspense`**: React's `Suspense` component is used to wrap the lazy-loaded component. While the component is being loaded, React will display a fallback UI (like a loading spinner).
* This approach improves performance by splitting the bundle, so large components (like charts, modals, etc.) are only loaded **when needed**.

#### **What happens?**

* Initially, `ChartComponent` is not loaded. Once it's needed (when the page renders), it's fetched asynchronously, improving the app's load time.

You want to load a component (for example, a complex chart or a modal) **only when it’s needed** to improve performance.

### **Example: Async Component Using `async` and `await`**

Here’s an example where we want to **fetch some data** before rendering the component.

#### **Scenario**:

You have a component that displays user details fetched from an API. Instead of waiting for the component to render first and then making the API call (which might result in showing loading indicators), you want to **wait for the data to be fetched before rendering**.

```tsx
// Example of a simple async component in Next.js

import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

// An async function to fetch user details
async function getUserDetails() {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/user');
    return response.data;  // Return the user data
}

// This is an async component where we call the async function
export default async function UserDetailsPage() {
    const userData = await getUserDetails();  // Await the data before rendering the component

    // After the data is fetched, the component is rendered
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>User Details</h1>
            <p>Email: {userData.email}</p>
            <p>Name: {userData.name}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### **Key Points**:

* **Async Function**: `getUserDetails` is an async function that fetches data from an API.
* **Await Data**: `await getUserDetails()` ensures the component waits for the data before rendering.
* **Server-Side Rendering**: Since this example is in a Next.js page component, it would be rendered server-side (SSR). The data will be fetched **on the server**, ensuring SEO benefits because the content is pre-populated before sending the HTML to the client.

#### **What happens?**

* The page waits for the user data to be fetched **before rendering** the content, so users (and search engines) see the complete, populated HTML.


### **What Makes a Component "Async"?**

A component can be considered "async" in two main ways:

1. **Fetching data asynchronously** before rendering (e.g., using `async/await` to fetch API data in a `useEffect` or server-side).
2. **Being loaded asynchronously** (e.g., lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`).

---

### **How It Works in Next.js** (With Server-Side Rendering)

In **Next.js**, an **async component** that uses `async/await` will be **pre-rendered on the server**. This means that when a crawler (like Googlebot) comes to your page, it will see **the fully populated HTML** instead of having to rely on JavaScript running in the browser to fetch data.

For **API calls**, Next.js uses `getServerSideProps` (for SSR) or `getStaticProps` (for static generation). These are async functions that let you fetch data server-side, ensuring SEO benefits.

```tsx
// Example using getServerSideProps (Server-Side Rendering) in Next.js

import axios from 'axios';

export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/user');
    return {
        props: { userData: response.data },  // Pass the data as props to the component
    };
}

export default function UserPage({ userData }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>User Info</h1>
            <p>Email: {userData.email}</p>
            <p>Name: {userData.name}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### **Summary of Async Components**:

1. **Async Components (Server-side)**: These are components that use `async/await` to fetch data or resources before rendering. They ensure the content is available when the page is loaded.
   * Example: Using `async/await` in server-side components (`getServerSideProps` or directly in the component).
   * SEO Benefit: Content is pre-rendered and available for crawlers.
2. **Async Components (Client-side)**: These components are often lazy-loaded or dynamically import resources only when needed, improving performance by splitting the bundle.

   * Example: Using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for client-side components.

**In simple terms**, an **async component** is any component that deals with asynchronous operations, like fetching data or dynamically loading code, to improve performance, user experience, and SEO.

#### Data Fetching in NextJS
You should fetch the user details on the server side and pre-render the page before returning it to the user.
In nextjs the initial req for html comes back with the data gets hydrated.
>
Browser asks for the html and nextjs server talks to the backend and gets data then it hydrates the html with data and return it to the browser. (Assuming  there is a separate backend that exists with whom nextjs server talks)

Eg:
```tsx
    import axios from "axios";

    async function getUserDetails() {
        const response = await axios.get("https://varunsweb.workers.dev/api/v1/user/details")
        return response.data;
    }

    export default async function Home() {
        const userData = await getUserDetails();

        return (
            <div>
                {userData.email}
                {userData.name}
            </div>
        );
    }
```

Created an async component, It aint supported by react, next recently supports the async components.
**You can actually do async operations at the top of your components. This is the standard way to do data fetching in the nextjs, you fetch it at the top of your components.**

The very first html hydrated with the data we fetch in the component.
Shouldnt we fetch data in recoil selector for data fetching? You couldnot do it very well on the server, which is why if you want to use recoil then it may not be the best architecture.

### Loaders in Nextjs
Whatever route you think is going to get stuck, add a loading.tsx there. During the time that the await is happening, loading.tsx will get called.

You can check by adding an artificial delay :

"await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 5000));"

This loading only makes sense if you have an async function that is doing some data fetching before rendering.

# Introducing api routes in Next.js
NextJS lets you write backend routes, just like express does. This is why Next is considered to be a full stack framework.

The benefits of using NextJS for backend includes - 
- Code in a single repo
- All standard things you get in a backend framework like express
- Server components can directly talk to the backend

We want to introduce a route that returns hardcoded values for a user’s details (email, name, id)
- Introduce a new folder called 'api'
- Add a folder inside called 'user'
- Add a file inside called 'route.ts'
- Initialize a 'GET' route inside it

```ts
    import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
    
    export async function GET() {
        return NextResponse.json({ 
            username: "varun", 
            email: "varun@gmail.com" 
        })
    }
```


**Frontend:**
- Create app/signup/page.tsx
- Create a simple Page
```tsx
    import { Signup } from "@/components/Signup"

    export default function() {
        return <Signup />
    }
```
- Create components/Signup.tsx
- Convert components/Signup.tsx to a client component
"use client"
- Add a  onclick handler that sends a POST request to /user
- After successful signup you navigate to "/" page
```tsx
    import { useRouter } from "next/router";    //remember to import from router not from /navigation
    const router = useRouter();

    router.push("/") //use this after the onclick handler function
```

**Backend:**
- Add a POST route that takes the users email and password and for now just returns them back
- Navigate to app/api/user/route.ts
- Initialize a POST endpoint inside it
```ts
    import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

    export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
        const body = await req.json();

        return NextResponse.json({ username: body.username, password: body.password })
    }
```

**Database:**
Adding prisma to a Next.js project is straightforward. Get the connection string free from aiven or neondb
- "npm install prisma"
- "npx prisma init"
- Create a simple user schema
```ts
    model User {
        id        Int     @id  @default(autoincrement())
        username  String  @unique
        password  String
    }
```
- Replace .env with your own Postgres URL  DATABASE_URL=""
- "npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema"
- "npx prisma generate"
- Signup Route code POST
```ts
    export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
        const body = await req.json();
        // should add zod validation here
        const user = await client.user.create({
            data: {
                username: body.username,
                password: body.password
            }
        });

        console.log(user.id);

        return NextResponse.json({ message: "Signed up" });
    }
```
- GET endpoint code
```ts
    export async function GET() {
        const user = await client.user.findFirst({});
        return Response.json({ name: user?.username, email: user?.username })
    }
```




But there is a problem in fetching the data with axios. We are fetching the details of the user by hitting an HTTP endpoint in getUserDetails.
See, getUserDetails runs on the server. This means we’re sending a request from a server back to the server.
*Better Solution:*
```tsx
    import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

    const client = new PrismaClient();

    async function getUserDetails() {
        try {
            const user = await client.user.findFirst({});
            return {
            name: user?.username,
            email: user?.username
            }
        }  catch(e) {
            console.log(e);
        }
    }
```
>
Here it seems that this file in which we defined a component has a prisma client import, doesnt that mean that this frontend can talk to the database, it seems clear that the code and logic that should reside on the backend is on the frontend. But as long as youre using a server component this code will never reach the frontend, this function call getUserDetails never reaches the frontend, only the final render reaches the frontend.
>
Basically dont do the http calls here if it is the same server, simply do a User.FindOne...

**Body, Header and Query Params in Next req:**
```ts
    const body = await req.json();
    console.log(req.headers.get("authorization"));
    console.log(req.nextUrl.searchParams.get("name"));
```
unlike express where we use express.json() middleware, we dont need this in nextjs, it takes care of it.


### Singleton prisma client
If youre usinf NextJS and youre running it in the dev mode, you should not initialize client like this.
"const client = new PrismaClient();"
you still can and you cant see any issue, but as you restart the application again and again, you'll see a common error that will come that looks like this "there are already 10 instances of the prisma client actively running". As you keep saving, code keeps on recompiling, it keeps on generating new connections to the prisma database and at some point you have a lot of connections.
You can convert it into a singleton. You can instanciate a single connection to the prisma client and save it on the global this object.
Make a global db.ts file and:
```ts
    import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

    console.log("inside db.ts and ");

    const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
        console.log("prisma client instantiated");
        return new PrismaClient();
    }

    declare global {
        var prisma: undefined | ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>
    }

    const prisma = globalThis.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton();

    export default prisma;

    if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalThis.prisma = prisma
```


## Server Actions
We wrote an API endpoint that let’s the user sign up in the app/api/user.ts. What if you could do a simple function call (even on a client component that would run on the server?)  Under the hood, still an HTTP request would go out. But you would feel like you’re making a function call
```ts
    // Server Component
    export default function Page() {
        // Server Action
        async function create() {
            'use server'
        
            // ...
        }
        
        return (
            // ...
        )
    }
```

Steps to follow
- Create actions/user.ts file (you can create it in a different folder)
- Write a function that takes username and password as input and stores it in the DB
```ts
    "use server"

    import client from "@/db"

    export async function signup(username: string, password: string) {
        // should add zod validation here
        const user = await client.user.create({
            data: {
                username: username,
                password: password
            }
        });

        console.log(user.id);

        return "Signed up!"
    }
```

Update the Signup.tsx file to do the function call
```tsx
    import { signup } from "@/actions/user";

    <button 
        onClick={async () => {
            const response = await signup(username, password);
            localStorage.setItem("token", response);
            router.push("/");
        }} 
        type="button" 
        className="mt-8 w-full text-white bg-gray-800 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 me-2 mb-2"
    >Sign in</button>
```
Benefits of server actions
- Single function can be used in both client and server components
- Gives you types of the function response on the frontend (very similar to trpc)
- Can be integrated seamlessly with forms
