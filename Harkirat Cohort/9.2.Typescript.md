# TypeScript

- Statically-typed languages like C++ provide early error detection during compilation, ensuring type consistency.
- Dynamically-typed languages like JavaScript offer flexibility but may require careful handling to avoid unexpected runtime errors.

Microsoft introduced TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

- TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to declare the types of variables, parameters, and return values at compile-time.
- TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript during the compilation process, ensuring that the resulting code is compatible with various JavaScript environments and browsers.
- TypeScript introduces concepts like interfaces and type declarations, enabling developers to define clear contracts for their code.
- IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that support TypeScript offer improved code navigation, autocompletion, and better refactoring capabilities.
- Developers write TypeScript code using .ts or .tsx files, employing TypeScript's syntax with features like static typing, interfaces, and type annotations.
- The TypeScript compiler (tsc) translates TypeScript code into plain JavaScript, allowing it to run in any JavaScript environment.
- Configuration for the compilation process can be provided via a tsconfig.json file.



*JavaScript Execution:*
    - The generated JavaScript code can now be executed by any JavaScript runtime or browser.
    - Developers can include the resulting JavaScript files in HTML documents or use them in Node.js environments.

*Runtime Environment:*
    - In the chosen runtime environment, the JavaScript code is interpreted or compiled by the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
    - Just-in-time (JIT) compilation or interpretation occurs to convert the code into machine code that the computer's processor can execute.

TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript through the TypeScript Compiler (tsc).
This compilation process ensures that TypeScript's features are compatible with existing JavaScript environments, enabling developers to benefit from static typing during development while still producing standard JavaScript for execution.

In addition to the TypeScript Compiler (tsc), several alternative tools like esbuild: a highly performant JavaScript bundler and minifier, but it also supports TypeScript.



- (npx tsc --init)  generate a tsconfig.json file.

- (tsc -b)
    The -b flag tells TypeScript to build the project based on the configuration in tsconfig.json. This generates a JavaScript file (index.js) from the TypeScript source

Catching type errors at compile time, by providing static typing, TypeScript enhances code reliability and helps identify potential issues before runtime. This is particularly valuable in large codebases where early error detection can save time and prevent bugs.


Basic types in typescript - Number, string, Boolean, null, undefined


- Write a TypeScript function named sum that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum:
```ts
    function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
```

- Understand Type Inference in TypeScript: 
```ts
    function isLegal(age: number): boolean {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
```

- Work with functions as parameters in TypeScript. (TypeScript function named delayedCall that takes another function (fn) as input and executes it after a delay of 1 second):
```ts
    function delayedCall(fn: () => void): void {    //The `fn: () => void` part means fn is a function that doesn’t take any arguments and doesn’t return a value.
        setTimeout(fn, 1000);
    }

    // Example Usage
    delayedCall(function() {
        console.log("hi there");
    });
```


#### The tsconfig.json File in TypeScript
The tsconfig.json file in TypeScript is a configuration file that provides settings for the TypeScript compiler (tsc).  
Options in tsconfig.json :-
- Target Option
    - specifies the ECMAScript target version to which the TypeScript compiler (tsc) will compile the TypeScript code. eg- "es5"
    ```ts
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "target": "es5",
                // Other options...
            }
        }
    ```

- rootDir
    - The rootDir option in a tsconfig.json file specifies the root directory where the TypeScript compiler (tsc) should look for .ts files.
    - It is considered a good practice to set rootDir to the source folder (src)
    ```ts
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "rootDir": "src",
                // Other options...
            }
        }
    ```

- outDir
    - The outDir option defines the output directory where the TypeScript compiler will place the generated .js files.
        ```ts
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "outDir": "dist",
                // Other options...
            }
        }
    ```

- noImplicitAny
    - The noImplicitAny option in a tsconfig.json file determines whether TypeScript should issue an error when it encounters a variable with an implicit any type.
    - Enabled ("noImplicitAny": true)

- removeComments
    - The removeComments option in a tsconfig.json file determines whether comments should be included in the final JavaScript output.
    - Enabled ("removeComments": true):

```ts
"compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es6", // or your desired ECMAScript version
        "module": "commonjs", // or your desired module system
        "noImplicitAny": true,
        "removeComments": true,
        // other options...
    },
```

>
These options provide flexibility and control over the compilation process, allowing you to structure your project and handle type-related scenarios according to your preferences.

## Interfaces
- In TypeScript, an interface is a way to define a contract for the shape of an object.
- It allows you to specify the expected properties, their types, and whether they are optional or required.

eg:
```tsx
    interface User {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
        email: string;
        age: number;
    }

    const user: User = {
        firstName: "harkirat",
        lastName: "singh",
        email: "email@gmail.com",
        age: 21,
    };
```


Create a React component that takes todos as an input and renders them:-
```tsx
    // Define an interface to specify the structure of a todo object
    interface TodoType {
        title: string;
        description: string;
        done: boolean;
    }

    // Define the input prop for the Todo component
    interface TodoInput {
        todo: TodoType;
    }

    // Create a React component 'Todo' that takes a 'todo' prop and renders it
    function Todo({ todo }: TodoInput): JSX.Element {
    //JSX.Element: This type specifically indicates that the value is a React element created using JSX. It is used to type the return value of React components.
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>{todo.title}</h1>
                <h2>{todo.description}</h2>
                {/* Additional rendering logic can be added for other properties */}
            </div>
        );
    }
```


**In TypeScript, you can implement interfaces using classes. This provides a way to define a blueprint for the structure and behavior of a class. Let's take an example:**
Assume you have a `Person` interface:

```tsx
    interface Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;
        greet(phrase: string): void;
    }
```

Now, you can create a class that adheres to this interface:

```tsx
    class Employee implements Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;

        constructor(n: string, a: number) {
            this.name = n;
            this.age = a;
        }

        greet(phrase: string) {
            console.log(`${phrase} ${this.name}`);
        }
    }
```

Here's what's happening:

- The `Employee` class implements the `Person` interface.
- It has properties (`name` and `age`) matching the structure defined in the interface.
- The `greet` method is implemented as required by the interface.

> This approach is handy when creating various types of persons (like Manager, CEO), ensuring they all adhere to the same interface contract. It maintains consistency in the structure and behavior across different classes.
>



## Types
In TypeScript, types allow you to aggregate data together in a manner very similar to interfaces.
They provide a way to define the structure of an object, similar to how interfaces do.

```tsx
    type User = {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
        age: number;
    };
```

### Features

1. **Unions:**
Unions allow you to define a type that can be one of several types. This is useful when dealing with values that could have different types. For instance, imagine you want to print the ID of a user, which can be either a number or a string:
    
```tsx
    type StringOrNumber = string | number;
    
    function printId(id: StringOrNumber) {
        console.log(`ID: ${id}`);
    }
    
    printId(101);     // ID: 101
    printId("202");   // ID: 202
```
Unions provide flexibility in handling different types within a single type definition.
    

1. **Intersection:**
Intersections allow you to create a type that has every property of multiple types or interfaces. If you have types like `Employee` and `Manager`, and you want to create a `TeamLead` type that combines properties of both:
    
```tsx
    type Employee = {
      name: string;
      startDate: Date;
    };
    
    type Manager = {
      name: string;
      department: string;
    };
    
    type TeamLead = Employee & Manager;
    
    const teamLead: TeamLead = {
      name: "Varun",
      startDate: new Date(),
      department: "Software Developer"
    };
```
Intersections provide a way to create a new type that inherits properties from multiple existing types.

In summary, while types and interfaces are similar in defining object structures, types in TypeScript offer additional features like unions and intersections, making them more versatile in certain scenarios.

### Interfaces vs Types
- Extension and Merging:
    - **Type:**
        - Supports extending types.
        - Can't be merged, if you define another type with the same name, it will override the previous one.
    - **Interface:**
        - Supports extending interfaces using the `extends` keyword.
        - Automatically merges with the same-name interfaces, combining their declarations.

- Declaration vs. Implementation:
    - **Type:**
        - Can represent any type, including primitives, unions, intersections, etc.
        - Suitable for describing the shape of data.
    - **Interface:**
        - Mainly used for describing the shape of objects.
        - Can also be used to define contracts for classes.

- Object Literal Strictness:
    - **Type:**
        - Types are more lenient when dealing with object literal assignments.
    - **Interface:**
        - Interfaces enforce strict object literal shapes.


#### When to Use Which

- **Use Types:**
    - For advanced scenarios requiring union types, intersections, or mapped types.
    - When dealing with primitive types, tuples, or non-object-related types.
    - Creating utility types using advanced features like conditional types.
- **Use Interfaces:**
    - When defining the structure of objects or contracts for class implementations.
    - Extending or implementing other interfaces.
    - When consistency in object shape is a priority.


**Choose types for flexibility and advanced type features, and use interfaces for object shapes, contracts, and class implementations, ensuring a consistent and readable codebase.**



Commonly Used things and examples you need to know and these are frequently used in the react:

1. **ReactNode**
ReactNode is a type that represents anything that can be rendered in React. This includes elements, strings, numbers, fragments, arrays, or even null.

```ts
    import React, { ReactNode } from 'react';

    interface Props {
        children: ReactNode;
    }

    const Container: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
        return <div>{children}</div>;
    };
```

2. **ReactComponent**
This type is used to describe a React component, either class-based or functional. It can accept props and define the component's structure.

```ts
    import React from 'react';

    type MyComponentType = React.ComponentType<{ title: string }>;

    const MyComponent: MyComponentType = ({ title }) => <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

3. **FC (Function Component)**
FC (Function Component) is a type alias that denotes a functional component in React. It automatically includes the children prop and infers the props type.

```ts
    import React, { FC } from 'react';

    const MyComponent: FC<{ message: string }> = ({ message, children }) => (
        <div>
            {message}
            {children}
        </div>
    );
```

4. **JSX.IntrinsicElements**
This interface contains the definitions for all built-in JSX elements, allowing TypeScript to understand what elements can be rendered and their expected attributes.

```ts
    declare global {
        namespace JSX {
            interface IntrinsicElements {
                'custom-element': { propA: string; propB?: number }; // Define a custom element
            }
        }
    }

    // Usage
    <custom-element propA="value" propB={42}></custom-element> // Valid

```

5. **ReactElement**
ReactElement represents a React element returned by a component or JSX. It is more specific than ReactNode, as it always refers to elements created with React.

```ts
    import React, { ReactElement } from 'react';

    const element: ReactElement = <div>Hello World</div>;
```

6. **Ref**
Ref is a way to reference a DOM element or a class component instance directly. This is particularly useful for manipulating the DOM or accessing component methods.

```ts
    import React, { useRef } from 'react';

    const MyInput: React.FC = () => {
        const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

        const focusInput = () => {
            inputRef.current?.focus();
        };

        return (
            <>
                <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
                <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
            </>
        );
    };
```

7. Dispatch
Type for dispatching actions in state management.

```ts
    import { useReducer } from 'react';

    type Action = { type: 'increment' } | { type: 'decrement' };

    const reducer = (state: number, action: Action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'increment':
                return state + 1;
            case 'decrement':
                return state - 1;
            default:
                return state;
        }
    };

    const Counter: React.FC = () => {
        const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0);

        return (
            <div>
                <p>{count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
                <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
            </div>
        );
    };
```

8. SetStateAction
Type for the state setter function returned by useState.

```ts
    import React, { useState, SetStateAction } from 'react';

    const Counter: React.FC = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

        const increment = () => {
            setCount((prev: number) => prev + 1);
        };

        return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;
    };
```

9. ContextType
Represents the type of the context value in React’s Context API.

```ts
    import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

    const MyContext = createContext<{ value: string } | undefined>(undefined);

    const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
        const context = useContext(MyContext);
        if (!context) throw new Error('MyComponent must be used within a MyProvider');
        return <div>{context.value}</div>;
    };
```

10. FormEvent
Type for typing event handlers for forms.

```ts
    import React, { useState, FormEvent } from 'react';

    const Form: React.FC = () => {
        const [input, setInput] = useState('');

        const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            console.log(input);
        };

        return (
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                <input
                    type="text"
                    value={input}
                    onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
                />
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>
        );
    };
```
