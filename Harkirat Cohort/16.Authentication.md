# Authentication
Authentication is the process of letting users signup/signin into websites via username / password or using SSO (single sign on).

### JWT + local storage auth
You take userid and password from body and sends to the database. The server checks in the database if the password is right, is the user verified, if, then it sends a jwt token which client(browser) stores in the local storage.
Now client need to send the token in every subsequent request that requires authentication. They send the authorization header along, backend decodes it and verifies it as the user.

## Authentication using cookies
Cookies in web development are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. They are designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember things (very similar to local storage)
Session Management: Cookies allow websites to identify users and track their individual session states across multiple pages or visits.
Personalization: Websites use cookies to personalize content and ads. For instance, cookies might store information about a user's preferences, allowing the site to tailor content or advertisements to those interests.
Tracking: Cookies can track users across websites, providing insights into browsing behavior. This information can be used for analytics purposes, to improve website functionality, or for advertising targeting.
Security: Secure cookies can be used to enhance the security of a website by ensuring that the transmission of information is only done over an encrypted connection, helping to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 
We will be focussing on point 4
Why not local storage?
- Cookies and LocalStorage both provide ways to store data on the client-side, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.
- Cookies are send with every request to the website (by the browser) (you donâ€™t have to explicitly add a header to the fetch call). This point becomes super important in Next.js.
    - Cookies can have an expiry attached to them
    - Cookies can be be restricted to only https and to certain domains


You cannot use authorization header thing in nextjs application. The first req that goes out, you cant put the auth header there. Nextjs does SSR, the very first req comes to the server has the user data, lets say the users purchases are already rendered in the server and returned back.
In react case it doesnt matter as first req, we hit cdn and gets the bundle files that are same for everyone, and then browser sends req to the backend and gets the token, so in case of react local storage works.
So, you want the user specific data in very first request you need to use cookies. You logout, it clears the cookie. And when you sign in the server sends a set cookie header, browser sets it in its set cookies section. You can add restrictions on the cookies like exp time, etc...

### Properties of cookies
- Types of cookies
    Persistent - Stay even if u close the window
    Session - Go away after the window closes
    Secure - Sent only over secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS).
- Properties of cookies
    HttpOnly - Can not be accessed by client side scripts
    SameSite - Ensures cookies are not send on cross origin requests
        1. Strict
        2. Lax - Only GET requests and on top level navigation
        3. None
- Domains - You can also specify what all domains should the cookie be sent from
 
CSRF attacks
Cross site request forgery attacks were super common because of cookies and hence the SameSite attribute was introduced.

### Using cookies in the backend
So there is a project in Auth folder of my study practice folder. In that there is used the cookies auth. Open that and see notes:
- You need to use a cookie parser to parse the very long cookie string and get the token.
- In cors you need to pass credentials as true(in express if youre using cors and you want cookies to be set you need to pass credentials as true) and origin as the frontend from where the cookies can be set.
You have seen websites in which when you click signin or signup it takes to the .auth domain af that website.
eg: www.varun.comn and it takes to www.auth.varun.com

Now in signin route you check the credentials from the database and then generate a token sign it and return it(in the local storage approach). But in here you simply call 
res.cookie and pass the name of the token and the token. res.cookie("token", token); this function will put the cookie in the Set-Cookie header.







# NextAuth
NextAuth is a library that lets you do authentication in Next.js
Popoular choices while doing auth include - 
- External provider - 
    https://auth0.com/
    https://clerk.com/
    Firebase auth
- In house using cookies
- NextAuth

NextAuth supports various providers
- Login with email
- Login with google
- Login with facebook

**Catch routes in NextJS:**
You want to catch all the requests that are going out to some routes...
In nextjs project:
- Create app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
```tsx
    import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"

    export function GET(req: NextRequest) {
        return NextResponse.json({
            message: "Handler"
        })
    }
```
- Try going to the random endpoints like "localhost:3000/api/auth/random/random2"
- Try logging the sub-routes youre at:
```tsx
    import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"

    export function GET(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { nextauth: string[] } }) {
        console.log(params.nextauth[0])
        return NextResponse.json({
            message: "Handler"
        })
    }
```
or you can get it in args and do args.params.authRoutes...


### Give NextAuth access to a catch-all
Adding providers - There are three broad types of providers
- OAuth (Login with google, etc...)
- Email (Passwordless Email login via email OTP)
- Credentials (your own strategy)



NextAuth is a session management library. Given you have a user in your database, it will create cookies, manage session, it doesnt takes care of how and where it stores the user.

## Credentials Provider
You write nextauth in the api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts file.
This page is autogenerated by nextauth based on what credentials you tell it to support.
```ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';

const handler = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
        name: 'Credentials',
        credentials: {
          username: { label: 'email', type: 'text', placeholder: '' },
          password: { label: 'password', type: 'password', placeholder: '' },
        },
        async authorize(credentials: any) {
            
            return {
                id: "user1"
            };
        },
      })
  ],
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET
})


export const GET = handler;
export const POST = handler;
```
authorize is the function which will be called when you click on the signin button.

Then you hit localhost:3000/api/auth/signin you get a ui given by the nextauth itself. You wite login of the signup page in your frontend endpoint, we'll see how afterwords.
In backend route in the handler NextAuth function we pass in CredentialsProvider in that authorize function, it helps in session management, when user clicks on signin button after giving inputs, control will reach here and you will wrute logic of checking the user in database and return what you want like userid.
If user didnt find then you return null so that /signin understands and it sends error to the ui.
When you see the inspect and see header in the network tab you can see Set-Cookie section in header you got in response after successful signin.
And in every subsequest request cookie goes out in header.
In front end you can import {signIn, signOut} from "next-auth/react" and
