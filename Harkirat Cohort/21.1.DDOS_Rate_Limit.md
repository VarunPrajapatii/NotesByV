## Why rate limitting?
 
- Preventing Overload: Rate limiting controls how often a user or system can make requests to a service. This helps prevent overuse of resources, ensuring that the system remains available and responsive for all users. For example, rate limiting can stop a single user from making thousands of login attempts in a minute, which could otherwise degrade service for others.
- Mitigating Abuse: Without rate limiting, an application could be more susceptible to abuse such as brute force attacks on passwords or spamming behavior. By limiting how often someone can perform an action, it reduces the feasibility of such attacks.
- Managing Traffic: In high-traffic scenarios, like ticket sales for a popular event, rate limiting can help manage the load on a server, preventing crashes and ensuring a fairer distribution of service like bandwidth or access to the purchasing system.
- DDoS Protection: A DDoS attack involves overwhelming a site with a flood of traffic from multiple sources, which can make the website unavailable. DDoS protection mechanisms detect unusual traffic flows and can filter out malicious traffic, helping to keep the service operational despite the attack.


So you rate limit based on IP. Instead of directly having all the requests on the server we use load blancer. Why? Because someone can req many times, like running a for loop million time with fetch in it.
Someone can brute force attack, like trying signing in with fetch with loop with the list of passwords, like hit and trial. If someone does it you can block it. 
But there is DDOS attacks that can happen, like instead of one ip, many browsers/clients flood request. But the que is how can we judge if its a ddos attack of geneuinly some high traffic came in?

If you have many endpoints, should you limit all of them? Yes but you shouldnt rate limit aggressively you should be lenient with rate limit. But an endpoit like recovering password, where you lets say clicks on forget password and in otp end point you cycle through all the otp with loop, then one of the otp will work. So this endpoint should be heavily rate limited, like 1-2req/sec.
This was the brute force attack that Anand Prakash did on facebook and find a vulnerability.
That is like the endpoint where you must have aggressive rate limits. Generally you should add rate limit throughout your application.
