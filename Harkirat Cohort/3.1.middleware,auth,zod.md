# Middlewares, Global Catches & Zod

- Middlewares: behind-the-scenes helpers that tidy up things before your main code does its thing. Global catches: safety nets for your code, they catch unexpected issues before they cause chaos. And finally, Zod: a library that ensures efficient input validation on your behalf.
- `next()` is a callback function that is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.
- `app.use(express.json())` is middleware that parses incoming JSON payloads in the request body, express.urlencoded(), is used for parsing form data in the request body.
- Middleware helps in processing the request at different stages and is essential for tasks like parsing, logging, authentication, and more in a modular and organized way.
- 3 ways to send inputs to a Request: 
    1. Query Parameters: Simple instructions visible in the web address, Good for simple stuff you want everyone to see, like search terms in a URL.
    2. Body: Hidden part of the request for more detailed info, Great for sending lots of information, especially when you're submitting something like a form.
    3. Headers: Perfect for passing along special information that doesn't fit neatly in the URL or body, like who you are or how to handle the data.

### Global Catches (Error-Handling Middlewares):
### Importance of **Global Error Handling:**

1. **Centralized Handling:**
    - Global catch blocks allow you to centrally manage and handle errors that occur anywhere in your application. Instead of handling errors at each specific location, you can capture and process them in a centralized location.
2. **Consistent Error Handling:**
    - Using a global catch mechanism ensures a consistent approach to error handling throughout the application. You can define how errors are logged, reported, or displayed in one place, making it easier to maintain a uniform user experience.
3. **Fallback Mechanism:**
    - Global catches often serve as a fallback mechanism. If an unexpected error occurs and is not handled locally, the global catch can capture it, preventing the application from crashing and providing an opportunity to log the error for further analysis.


### Using `zod` Library for Schema Validation:

`zod` is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It provides a concise way to define schemas and validate input data.


    ```jsx
    const loginSchema = z.object({
        username: z.string().min(3),
        password: z.string().min(6),
    });

    app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
        const { username, password } = req.body;

        try {
            loginSchema.parse({ username, password });
            // Proceed with authentication logic
            // ...
            res.json({ success: true });
        } catch (error) {
            res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid input.', details: error.errors });
        }
    });
    ```


## Zod:

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It provides a simple and expressive way to define the structure and constraints of your data, allowing you to easily validate and parse input against those specifications. Here's a brief explanation of Zod and its syntax:

### Zod Syntax Overview:

1. **Basic Types:**
    - Zod provides basic types such as `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, etc.
        
        ```jsx
        const schema = z.string();
        ```
        
2. **Object Schema:**
    - You can define the structure of an object using the `object` method and specify the shape of its properties.
        
        ```jsx
        const userSchema = z.object({
          username: z.string(),
          age: z.number(),
        });
        ```
        
3. **Nested Schemas:**
    - You can nest schemas within each other to create more complex structures.
        
        ```jsx
        const addressSchema = z.object({
          street: z.string(),
          city: z.string(),
        });
        
        const userSchema = z.object({
          username: z.string(),
          address: addressSchema,
        });
        ```
        
4. **Array Schema:**
    - You can define the schema for arrays using the `array` method.
        
        ```jsx
        const numbersSchema = z.array(z.number());
        ```
        
5. **Union and Intersection Types:**
    - Zod supports union and intersection types for more flexibility.
        
        ```jsx
        const numberOrStringSchema = z.union([z.number(), z.string()]);
        const combinedSchema = z.intersection([userSchema, addressSchema]);
        ```
        
6. **Optional and Nullable:**
    - You can make properties optional or nullable using `optional` and `nullable` methods.
        
        ```jsx
        const userSchema = z.object({
          username: z.string(),
          age: z.optional(z.number()),
          email: z.nullable(z.string()),
        });
        ```
        
7. **Custom Validators:**
    - Zod allows you to define custom validation logic using the `refine` method.
        
        ```jsx
        const positiveNumberSchema = z.number().refine((num) => num > 0, {
          message: 'Number must be positive',
        });
        ```
        
8. **Parsing and Validation:**
    - To validate and parse data, use the `parse` method. If the data is invalid, it throws an error with details about the validation failure.
        
        ```jsx
        try {
          const userData = userSchema.parse({
            username: 'john_doe',
            age: 25,
            address: {
              street: '123 Main St',
              city: 'Exampleville',
            },
          });
          console.log('Parsed data:', userData);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Validation error:', error.errors);
        }
        ```
        

### Why Zod:

- **TypeScript-First Approach:** Zod is designed with TypeScript in mind, providing strong type-checking and autocompletion for your schemas.
- **Concise and Expressive Syntax:** Zod's syntax is concise and expressive, making it easy to define complex data structures with minimal code.
- **Validation and Parsing:** Zod not only validates data but also automatically parses it into the expected TypeScript types.
- **Rich Set of Features:** Zod includes a variety of features, such as custom validation, optional and nullable types, union and intersection types, making it a powerful tool for data validation in your applications.




# Authentication and Databases

fetch() Method:
- The fetch() method in JavaScript is a modern API that allows you to make network requests, typically to retrieve data from a server. It is commonly used to interact with web APIs and fetch data asynchronously. 
- The fetch() method returns a Promise, making it easy to work with asynchronous operations using the .then() and .catch() methods.

Callback Functions:
- A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function.

Promises: 
- A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

Async/Await:
- async/await provides a more synchronous-looking code structure when dealing with asynchronous operations, especially when handling responses.

- `Callbacks` were the traditional way of handling asynchronous code.
- `Promises` introduced a more structured and readable way to handle async operations.
- `async/await` builds on top of Promises, offering a more synchronous coding style, making asynchronous code look similar to synchronous code.


### Try Catch Blocks

In JavaScript and many other programming languages, a `try-catch` block is a mechanism for handling exceptions or errors in a structured way. This construct is crucial for writing robust and fault-tolerant code.
1. **Execution in the Try Block:**
    - Code inside the `try` block is executed sequentially.
    - If an exception occurs at any point, the normal flow of execution is interrupted.
2. **Control Transfer to Catch Block:**
    - When an exception is thrown, control is transferred to the corresponding `catch` block.
    - The `catch` block is responsible for handling the exception.
3. **Exception Handling:**
    - Inside the `catch` block, developers can implement error-handling logic.
    - They can log the error, display a user-friendly message, or take alternative actions to recover from the error.

```js
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
  const result = 10 / 0; // Division by zero, will throw an exception
  console.log(result); // This line won't be executed
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the exception
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message); // Output: An error occurred: Cannot divide by zero
} finally {
  // Code inside the finally block will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
  console.log('Finally block executed');
}
```





### Authentication
Authentication refers to the process of validating the identity of a user, system, or application attempting to access a computer system, network, or online service.

1. Hashing
- Hashing is a one-way process that converts a password or any data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value.
- Hashing prevents storing plaintext passwords in the database, reducing the risk of data breaches

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// Hashing a password
    const plainPassword = 'user123';
    bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Hashed Password:', hash);

    // Verify a password
    bcrypt.compare('user123', hash, (err, result) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('Password Match:', result);
    });
    });
```

2. Encryption
- Unlike hashing, encryption is a two-way process that involves converting data into a format that can be easily reversed using a decryption key.
- Encrypting sensitive data adds an extra layer of security. Even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable without the decryption key.

```js
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    // Encryption
    const dataToEncrypt = 'Sensitive information';
    const encryptionKey = 'secretKey';
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey);
    let encryptedData = cipher.update(dataToEncrypt, 'utf-8', 'hex');
    encryptedData += cipher.final('hex');
    console.log('Encrypted Data:', encryptedData);

    // Decryption
    const decipher = crypto.createDecipher('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey);
    let decryptedData = decipher.update(encryptedData, 'hex', 'utf-8');
    decryptedData += decipher.final('utf-8');
    console.log('Decrypted Data:', decryptedData);
```

3. JWT
- A JSON Web Token, or JWT, is like a digital passport for information. It's a special kind of code that carries details about a user or some data. Imagine you have a passport when you travel to different countries – the passport holds your information and proves who you are. Similarly, a JWT carries information and proves certain things about you or the data it holds.
- You enter your username and password, the website creates a JWT. Now, instead of asking you for your username and password every time you click on something, you sends that token.

4. Local Storage
Local Storage is a client-side web storage mechanism that allows websites to store key-value pairs persistently on a user's device. Local Storage serves as a valuable tool in the authentication landscape, contributing to efficient session management and enhanced user experiences. After a successful authentication, the server generates an authentication token (e.g., JWT) for the user. This token is securely stored in the Local Storage of the user's browser. Instead of requiring users to authenticate themselves on every interaction, the stored token allows the server to recognize and validate the user swiftly, enhancing the user experience.

5. Authorization Header
Authorization header is a crucial component of HTTP requests that plays a key role in authenticating and authorizing users or clients to access certain resources on a server. The Authorization header is used to transmit credentials (such as tokens or API keys) from the client to the server. Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... Used in token-based authentication (e.g., JSON Web Tokens or OAuth), where a token represents the user's identity and permissions.




## **Cookies vs. Local Storage for Storing JWT Tokens:**

When it comes to storing JWT (JSON Web Tokens), both cookies and local storage are commonly used, but they have distinct characteristics and use cases. Here's a comparison to help you choose the appropriate option for your specific scenario:

### 1. **Cookies:**

- **Security:**
    
    Cookies can be more secure than local storage because they have an additional security feature called HTTP-only. When a cookie is marked as HTTP-only, it cannot be accessed by JavaScript, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    
- **Automatic Handling:**
    
    Cookies are automatically sent with every HTTP request to the domain, including requests for images, stylesheets, and scripts. This automatic handling can be advantageous for authenticating API requests made by the browser.
    
- **Expiration:**
    
    Cookies can have an expiration date, allowing the server to set a specific duration for which the token is valid. After expiration, the browser automatically removes the cookie.
    
- **Domain Restriction:**
    
    Cookies can be set to be domain-restricted, meaning they are only sent to the server from the same domain that set the cookie. This provides a level of security.
    

### 2. **Local Storage:**

- **Ease of Use:**
    
    Local storage is easier to use from a JavaScript perspective. You can set, get, and remove items directly using JavaScript without additional HTTP requests.
    
- **Capacity:**
    
    Local storage generally has a larger storage capacity compared to cookies.
    
- **No Automatic Handling:**
    
    Unlike cookies, local storage data is not automatically sent with every HTTP request. This means you need to manually attach the token to the headers of your API requests if you're using it for authentication.
    
- **No Expiration Handling:**
    
    Local storage does not provide built-in expiration handling. If you want to implement token expiration, you need to manage it manually in your code.
    

**Choosing Between Cookies and Local Storage:**

- **For Authentication:**
    
    Use cookies with HTTP-only flag for enhanced security, especially if you need to make authenticated API requests directly from the browser.
    
- **For Client-Side Interactions:**
    
    Use local storage if you primarily need to access the token on the client side and manage API requests manually.
    
- **Considerations:**
    
    Consider factors like security, automatic handling, and token expiration requirements when making your decision.
    

In many cases, a combination of both cookies and local storage might be used. Cookies can be employed for secure, HTTP-only storage, while local storage can be used for easy client-side access.



### fetch() vs axios()

1. **Syntax:**

- `fetch` uses a chain of `.then()` to handle responses, which might lead to a more verbose syntax. Axios, on the other hand, provides a concise syntax with `.then()` directly on the Axios instance.

2. **Handling HTTP Errors:**

- Both `fetch` and Axios allow error handling using `.catch()` or `.finally()`, but Axios may provide more detailed error information by default.

3. **Interceptors:**

- Axios provides a powerful feature with interceptors for both requests and responses, allowing global modifications. `fetch` lacks built-in support for interceptors.

4. **Request Configuration:**

- Axios allows detailed configuration of requests through a variety of options. `fetch` may require more manual setup for headers, methods, and other configurations.

5. **JSON Parsing:**

- Axios automatically parses JSON responses, while with `fetch`, you need to manually call `.json()` on the response.

6. **Browser Support:**

- `fetch` is natively supported in modern browsers, but if you need to support older browsers, you might need a polyfill. Axios has consistent behavior across various browsers and does not rely on native implementations.

7. **Size:**

- `fetch` is generally considered lightweight, being a part of the browser. Axios, being a separate library, introduces an additional file size to your project.




### MongoDB

MongoDB is a powerful and versatile NoSQL database that revolutionizes data management with its flexible and scalable design.
- MongoDB allows users to create multiple databases, acting as distinct containers for organizing and storing data.
- Within each database, collections serve as the equivalent of tables in relational databases. 
- MongoDB store info in Binary JSON format. It makes it flexable and readable.
- MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple servers or clusters. This horizontal scaling ensures optimal performance as data volumes and user loads increase.
- MongoDB provides a dynamic and scalable solution for modern data storage needs. Its schemaless design, JSON-based documents, and horizontal scalability make it well-suited for applications where flexibility, scalability, and diverse data types are crucial.

Backend connects to the database through Express, JWT and Mongoose library. While Express sets up the server, JWT helps with user authentication, and Mongoose facilitates interaction with the MongoDB database. Together, these libraries form a robust backend infrastructure for handling HTTP requests, securing routes, and managing data in the database.

### Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level, schema-based abstraction over the MongoDB JavaScript driver. Mongoose acts as a powerful bridge between Node.js applications and MongoDB databases. It streamlines the data modeling process, simplifies interactions with the database, and enhances the overall development experience when working with MongoDB in a Node.js environment.
