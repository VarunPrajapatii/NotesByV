## Auxiliary APIs

Auxiliary APIs, in the context of web development, refer to additional interfaces and functionalities provided by browsers or runtime environments beyond the core JavaScript language (as specified by ECMAScript).

1. **Node.js APIs:** : there are APIs specific to Node.js that provide access to the file system, networking, and other server-related functionalities.
1. **Third-Party APIs:** : Examples Google Maps API, Twitter API, or any other API that allows integration with external services.
1. **Web APIs:** : These are browser-specific APIs that provide additional functionality to JavaScript for interacting with the browser environment. Examples the DOM (Document Object Model), Fetch API for making network requests, and the Web Storage API for local storage.

> These APIs are not part of the JavaScript language specification (ECMAScript) but are essential for building web applications, interacting with external services, and handling server-side operations. They extend the capabilities of JavaScript in specific environments.

## Document

In JavaScript, the Document refers to the root object of the DOM. The document object represents the entire HTML document. The DOM allows JS to manipulate the HTML of the webpage. It's like giving JavaScript the power to update what you see on a webpage.

## The onInput() Function

The **`onInput`** function is an event handler in JavaScript that gets executed when the value of an input field is changed by the user. This event is triggered dynamically as the user types or modifies the content within the input field. The **`onInput`** event is commonly used to perform actions in real-time as the user interacts with the input element.

## Understanding Debouncing

Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, making them more efficient. In the context of `onInput` events, debouncing is often applied to delay the execution of certain actions (e.g., sending requests) until after a user has stopped typing for a specific duration.



## Throttling vs Rate Limiting

### **Throttling:**

- **Definition:** Controls the rate at which a specific action is performed.
- **Purpose:** Ensures a smooth user experience, preventing rapid consecutive actions.
- **Implementation:** Limits the frequency of a particular function within a specified time frame.

### **Rate Limiting:**

- **Definition:** Controls the number of requests a client can make within a specific time period.
- **Purpose:** Protects server resources, avoids abuse, and maintains fair usage.
- **Implementation:** Typically applied at the server/API level, limiting requests per second or minute.

### **Key Differences:**

- Throttling focuses on action frequency; rate limiting focuses on request count.
- Throttling can be applied to various actions; rate limiting is often used at the API level.
- Throttling aims for a smooth user experience; rate limiting protects server resources and enforces fairness.



# Reconcilers & Intro to React

Recognizing the intricacies involved, React, a JavaScript library, emerged as a powerful solution. React abstracts away much of the manual DOM manipulation complexity, providing developers with a declarative and component-based approach to building user interfaces.

When we refer to `state` in the context of our todo application, we are essentially talking about the current representation of the todo data within the application. In a more structured format, the `state` might look something like this:

```jsx
    [
        {
            id: 1,
            title: "Go to Gym",
            description: "Go to Gym from 7-9 PM"
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            title: "Read a Book",
            description: "Read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'"
        }
    ]
```

This concept of `state management` becomes crucial for maintaining a consistent and up-to-date representation of the data within the application.


## Virtual DOM

The concept of a `Virtual DOM` comes into play when dealing with efficient updates to the actual DOM. 

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When updates are made to the state of an application, a new Virtual DOM is created with the changes. This Virtual DOM is then compared with the previous Virtual DOM to identify the differences (known as "diffing").


Instead of clearing the entire parent element and re-rendering everything, the Virtual DOM helps identify specifically what has changed. Only the elements that have changed are manipulated in the actual DOM.
