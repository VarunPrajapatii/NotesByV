## Things we know so far
A virtual machine is a machine on the cloud that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer. It is created using virtualization software, which allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine, sharing its resources such as CPU, memory, and storage.
On the cloud where rain happens from, No. On the cloud is a term used when you rent servers from other people, so very rich companies has data centers around the world, and you can rent a server from them. What does renting means, hey i want your server for 3 days so that my users can access my application, and then i will pay you for that time and stop using it, and you can use it for someone else. This is called renting a server, and this is what cloud computing is all about. You can rent servers from companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc., and they will take care of the hardware, networking, and other infrastructure for you.

So we have seen how to rent machine(launch ec2 instance of aws), how to ssh into it, how to install software on it, and how to clone and run a project on it, and how use nginx to reverse proxy and how to put assign domain name on it, and how to pm2 start the application.
Thats how we used to host our application on http. Now things to learn further is how to make this application secure, how to make it run on https, how to make it scalable, how to make it load balanced, how to make it fault tolerant, and how to make it highly available. These are the things we will learn in the next few lessons.

Here we are going to learn about how to make our application secure, how to make it run on https.

# HTTPS Certificate Management

So in your nginx file you can directly put the certificate link and say listen 443 ssl; if you buy a certificate from somewhere else. But we are going to learn how to get a free certificate from Certbot, which is a free and open-source software that automates the process of obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, a free Certificate Authority (CA).

Certbot is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates. It can automatically configure your web server to use the newly obtained certificates and can also handle the renewal process, ensuring that your certificates are always up to date.
Certbot supports a wide range of web servers, including Apache, Nginx, and others. It can also be used with various operating systems, making it a versatile tool for managing SSL/TLS certificates.

So go to certbot website and tell what are you using for eg: nginx and tell what operating system you are using, and it will give you the commands to install certbot on your machine. Once you have installed certbot, you can use it to obtain a free SSL/TLS certificate for your domain. It will automatically configure the nginx files and set up the necessary configurations to enable HTTPS on your web server.




## What is HTTPS?
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses encryption to secure the communication between a web server and a client (usually a web browser). It ensures that the data exchanged between the two parties is encrypted, making it difficult for third parties to intercept or tamper with the information.
This is particularly important for protecting sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, and financial transactions. HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to establish a secure connection.
## What is a Certificate?
A certificate is a digital document that verifies the identity of a website and enables secure communication over HTTPS. It contains information about the website's owner, the certificate authority (CA) that issued the certificate, and the public key used for encryption. When a user visits a website with HTTPS, their browser checks the certificate to ensure it is valid and issued by a trusted CA.
If the certificate is valid, the browser establishes a secure connection with the server, allowing encrypted communication. If the certificate is invalid or expired, the browser will display a warning message to the user, indicating that the connection may not be secure.
## What is a Certificate Authority (CA)?
A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates to verify the identity of websites and organizations. CAs play a crucial role in the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by ensuring that the certificates they issue are legitimate and can be trusted by web browsers and other clients.
When a CA issues a certificate, it signs the certificate with its private key, creating a digital signature. This signature can be verified using the CA's public key, which is included in the browser's list of trusted CAs. If the signature is valid, the browser trusts the certificate and establishes a secure connection with the website.
## How to Obtain a Certificate?
To obtain a certificate, you typically need to follow these steps:
1. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on your server. This request contains your public key and information about your organization.
2. Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA) along with any required documentation to verify your identity.
3. The CA will validate your information and issue a digital certificate if everything checks out.
4. Install the certificate on your web server and configure it to use HTTPS.
5. Test the HTTPS connection to ensure it is working correctly and that the certificate is valid.
6. Regularly renew the certificate before it expires to maintain secure communication.
## How to Manage Certificates?
Managing certificates involves several key tasks to ensure that your HTTPS connections remain secure and valid. Here are some best practices for certificate management:
1. **Regularly Monitor Expiration Dates**: Keep track of when your certificates are set to expire. Set up reminders or automated alerts to renew them well in advance.
2. **Automate Renewal**: Use tools or services that can automate the renewal process for your certificates. This reduces the risk of downtime due to expired certificates.
3. **Use a Certificate Management System**: Consider using a dedicated certificate management system to help        you track, renew, and deploy certificates across your infrastructure.
4. **Implement Certificate Transparency**: Use certificate transparency logs to monitor and detect any unauthorized issuance of certificates for your domain. This helps ensure that only valid certificates are being used.
5. **Regularly Audit Certificates**: Periodically review your certificates to ensure they are still valid and issued by trusted CAs. Remove any unused or expired certificates from your servers.
6. **Backup Certificates**: Keep backups of your certificates and private keys in a secure location. This ensures that you can quickly restore them in case of accidental deletion or server failure.
7. **Educate Your Team**: Ensure that your team members understand the importance of certificate management and are trained on how to handle certificates securely. This includes understanding the risks of mishandling private keys and the importance of using strong encryption.
8. **Use Strong Encryption**: Ensure that your certificates use strong encryption algorithms and key sizes. Regularly review and update your encryption standards to align with industry best practices.
9. **Monitor Certificate Usage**: Keep track of where your certificates are being used across your infrastructure. This helps you identify any potential security issues or misconfigurations.
10. **Stay Informed**: Keep up to date with the latest developments in certificate management and security best practices. This includes understanding new vulnerabilities, changes in encryption standards, and updates from Certificate Authorities.
By following these best practices, you can effectively manage your certificates and maintain secure HTTPS connections for your web applications. Regular monitoring, automation, and adherence to security standards are key to ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of your HTTPS communications.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, certificate management is a critical aspect of maintaining secure web applications. By implementing the best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your certificates are properly managed, reducing the risk of security breaches and downtime. Remember to stay informed about the latest developments in certificate management and continuously improve your processes to adapt to the evolving security landscape.
