### React Returns
In React, a component can only return a single root element, commonly wrapped in a parent container (like a div) or fragments(<> </> or <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>). This rule exists because React needs a single entry point to render and manage the component's output. Fragments don't create an additional parent in the DOM but still satisfy the single-root rule. 

- Reconciliation involves identifying what parts of the virtual DOM have changed and efficiently updating only those parts in the actual DOM. The single-root structure simplifies this process by providing a clear entry point for React to determine where updates should occur.


**Object Destructuring:**
Object destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and convenient way. This can make your code cleaner and more readable. Here's a brief explanation with an example:

```jsx
    // Original Object
    const person = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30 };

    // Destructuring
    const { firstName, lastName, age } = person;

    // Extracted Values
    console.log(firstName); // Output: John
    console.log(lastName);  // Output: Doe
    console.log(age);       // Output: 30
```

**Default Values:**
You can also provide default values in case the property is not present in the object:

```jsx
    const { firstName, lastName, age, gender = 'Unknown' } = person;
    console.log(gender); // Output: Unknown (since 'gender' is not present in the 'person' object)
```

**Variable Assignment:**
You can use a different variable name during destructuring:

```jsx
    const { firstName: first, lastName: last } = person;
    console.log(first); // Output: John
    console.log(last);  // Output: Doe
```

**Nested Object Destructuring:**
Destructuring also works with nested objects:

```jsx
    const student = { name: 'Alice', details: { grade: 'A', age: 21 } };

    const { name, details: { grade, age } } = student;

    console.log(name);  // Output: Alice
    console.log(grade); // Output: A
    console.log(age);   // Output: 21
```
> Object destructuring provides a concise and expressive way to extract values from objects, making your code more readable and maintainable.

### When Does a Rerender Happen?
1. Changes in a state variable utilized within the component.
2. A re-render of a parent component, which subsequently triggers the re-rendering of all its child components. This cascading effect ensures synchronization throughout the component tree.

### Pushing the state down
Pushing the state down in React refers to the practice of managing state at the lowest possible level in the component tree. By doing so, you localize the state to the components that absolutely need it, reducing unnecessary re-renders in higher-level components.

### Reducing the amount of re-renders by Using Memoization
- Memoization in React, achieved through the useMemo hook, is a technique used to optimize performance by memoizing (caching) the results of expensive calculations.
- useMemo is often employed to memoize the results of computations derived from state or props. By doing so, you can ensure that the expensive computation is only performed when the dependencies (specified as the second argument to useMemo) change.

### Using keys
In React, when rendering a list of elements using the map function, it is crucial to assign a unique key prop to each element. The "key" is a special attribute that helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. This is essential for efficient updates and preventing unnecessary re-renders of the entire list.


## Wrapper Components
In React, wrapper components are used to encapsulate and group common styling or thematic elements that need to be applied consistently across different parts of an application. These components act as containers for specific sections or functionalities, allowing for a clean and modular structure.

Let's consider an example where we have a wrapper component called `Card` that provides a consistent styling for various content sections, such as blog posts. The `Card` component maintains the overall styling, while different contents can be dynamically injected.

```jsx
    // CardWrapper.js

    import React from 'react';

    const CardWrapper = ({ children }) => {
        return (
            <div style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '16px', margin: '16px', borderRadius: '8px' }}>
            {children}
            </div>
        );
    };

    export default CardWrapper;
```
Now, we can use this `CardWrapper` component to create specific cards for different content, such as blog posts, by providing the dynamic content as children:

```jsx
    // BlogPost.js

    import React from 'react';
    import CardWrapper from './CardWrapper';

    const BlogPost = ({ title, content }) => {
        return (
            <CardWrapper>
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <p>{content}</p>
            </CardWrapper>
        );
    };

    export default BlogPost;
```

> With this structure, we maintain a consistent card styling across different sections of our application, promoting reusability and making it easy to manage the overall theme. This approach is especially beneficial when you want to keep a uniform appearance for similar components while varying their internal content.

# React Hooks

React Hooks are simple Javascript functions that allow functional components in React to have state and lifecycle features that were previously available only in class components.
>
Using these hooks, developers can manage state, handle side effects, optimize performance, and create more reusable and readable functional components in React applications. Each hook serves a specific purpose, contributing to a more modular and maintainable codebase.
>
Some commonly used React Hooks are: `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`,  `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, `useLayoutEffect`

### useEffect()
`useEffect` is a React Hook used for performing side effects in functional components. It is often used for tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
The ability to return a cleanup function from useEffect is crucial for managing resources, subscriptions, or intervals created during the component's lifecycle. It helps ensure proper cleanup when the component is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks or unintended behavior. So, in useEffect we can use return to run the code we want it to run when component unmounts.

Eg: The useEffect hook is employed to perform the data fetching operation when the component is mounted. The empty dependency array [] ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render.

### useMemo()
`useMemo` is a React Hook that is used to memoize the result of a computation, preventing unnecessary recalculations when the component re-renders. It takes a function (referred to as the "memoized function") and an array of dependencies. The memoized function will only be recomputed when the values in the dependencies array change.
>
useMemo is particularly useful when dealing with expensive calculations or when you want to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computations during renders. It's important to use it judiciously, as overusing memoization can lead to increased complexity.
>

### useCallback
useCallback is a React Hook that is used to memoize a callback function, preventing unnecessary re-creation of the callback on each render. This can be useful when passing callbacks to child components to ensure they don't trigger unnecessary renders.
Using useCallback becomes more crucial when dealing with complex components or components with frequent re-renders, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary function creations.
Itâ€™s particularly useful when the callback function is passed down as a prop to child components or when a function is an argument to another hook (like useEffect or useMemo).

```js
{
    import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

    const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ computeResult }) => {
        console.log('ExpensiveComponent rendered');
        return <h2>Computed Result: {computeResult()}</h2>;
    });

    const ParentComponent = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        const [multiplier, setMultiplier] = useState(2);

        // Memoize the callback with useCallback and include dependencies
        const computeResult = useCallback(() => {
            console.log('Computing result...');
            return count * multiplier; // depends on count and multiplier
        }, [count, multiplier]); // The function will only change if count or multiplier changes

        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={() => setMultiplier(multiplier + 1)}>Increase Multiplier</button>
                <ExpensiveComponent computeResult={computeResult} />
            </div>
        );
    };

    export default ParentComponent;
}
```
The computeResult function is memoized and only recomputed when either count or multiplier changes.
ExpensiveComponent only re-renders when necessary, reducing the performance overhead.

Also note:
When a parent component re-renders, it does not necessarily mean that all of its child components will re-render. A child component will only re-render if:

- The props passed to the child component change.
- The state inside the child component changes.
- The parent forces the child to re-render by other means (like key changes or use of non-memoized props).

If ChildComponent is not wrapped in React.memo(), it will re-render every time the parent renders, regardless of whether the function is memoized or not, because React will always re-render its children unless explicitly prevented by React.memo().
If useCallback is used properly with React.memo(), the child component won't re-render unless the memoized callback's dependencies change.

>
In summary, useEffect is for handling side effects, useMemo is for memoizing values memoizes the result of a function, and useCallback is for memoizing functions itself. Each serves a different purpose in optimizing and managing the behavior of React components.
>

### React.memo()
React.memo() is a higher-order component (HOC) that helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of a functional component. It works similarly to PureComponent in class-based components, but for functional components.
- React.memo() wraps your component and only re-renders it if the props passed to the component have changed.
- If your component is expensive to render (like performing heavy calculations or rendering large lists), you can wrap it in React.memo() to ensure it only updates when necessary, improving performance.
To use it we just wrap the component with React.memo()
