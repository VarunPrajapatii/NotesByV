**Monorepos:**
A single repository (on github lets say) that holds all your frontend, backend, devops code.
Need to know?
Not exactly. Most of the times they are setup in the project already by the dev tools guy and you just need to follow the right practises

Why cant I just store services (backend, frontend etc) in various top level folders?
You can, and you should if your
Services are highly decoupled (dont share any code)
Services don’t depend on each other.
For eg - A codebase which has a Golang service and a JS service


**Why monorepos?**
Shared Code Reuse
Enhanced Collaboration
Optimized Builds and CI/CD: Tools like TurboRepo offer smart caching and task execution strategies that can significantly reduce build and testing times.
Centralized Tooling and Configuration: Managing build tools, linters, formatters, and other configurations is simpler in a monorepo because you can have a single set of tools for the entire project. 

Common monorepos frameworks: Lerna, nx, Turborepo(its not exactly a monorepo framework`), Yarn/npm workspace


#### Build System
A build system automates the process of transforming source code written by developers into binary code that can be executed by a computer. For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, this process can include transpilation (converting TS to JS eg: tsc), bundling (combining multiple files into fewer files eg: vite), minification (reducing file size), and more.

#### Monorepo Framework
A monorepo framework provides tools and conventions for managing projects that contain multiple packages or applications within a single repository (monorepo). This includes dependency management between packages, workspace configuration.

#### Build System Orchestrator
TurboRepo acts more like a build system orchestrator rather than a direct build system itself. It doesn't directly perform tasks like transpilation, bundling, minification, or running tests. Instead, TurboRepo allows you to define tasks in your monorepo that call other tools (which are the actual build systems) to perform these actions. 
These tools can include anything from tsc, vite etc. 

The key feature of TurboRepo is its ability to manage and optimize the execution of these tasks across your monorepo. It does this through:
**Caching**: TurboRepo caches the outputs of tasks, so if you run a task and then run it again without changing any of the inputs (source files, dependencies, configuration), TurboRepo can skip the actual execution and provide the output from the cache. This can significantly speed up build times, especially in continuous integration environments.
**Parallelization**: It can run independent tasks in parallel, making efficient use of your machine's resources. This reduces the overall time needed to complete all tasks in your project.
**Dependency Graph Awareness**: TurboRepo understands the dependency graph of your monorepo. This means it knows which packages depend on each other and can ensure tasks are run in the correct order.

Is turborepo relevant if we use nextjs?
If you only use nextjs then no. If you use next with an express server or websocket server or something else, then yes.

### Folder structure
- End user apps (websites/core backend)
    - apps/web - A Next.js website
    - apps/docs - A Docs website that has all the documentation related to your project
- Helper packages
- packages/ui - UI packages 
- packages/typescript-config - Shareable TS configuration
- packages/eslint-config - Shareable ESLine configuration 


To run the project do: "npm run dev"
You will notice two websites running on 
- localhost:3000
- localhost:3001

This means we have a single repo which has multiple projects which share code from packages/ui
Root package.json represents what command runs when you run 
turbo build goes into all packages and apps and runs npm run build inside them (provided they have it)
Same for dev and lint

In app/web folder
- Dependencies: It is a simple next.js app. But it uses some UI components from the packages/ui module
- package.json: If you explore package.json of apps/web, you will notice @repo/ui as a dependency
Like there is a Button component in the ui folder then you can use that button component in both the web and docs module.

>
What is the advantage of using multiple repos?
Deployement becomes easy here in turborepo deployement is a mess. One change in fe and deploy then all the code inc backend and all will be redeployed.

**Let’s add a new page:**
- Try adding a new page to /admin to the apps/web next.js website.
- It should use a simple Admin component from packages/ui
- Steps to follow - 
    - Create a new file admin.tsx inside packages/ui/src
    - Export a simple React component
```tsx
"use client";

export const Admin = () => {
  return (
    <h1>
        hi from admin component
    </h1>
  );
};
```
- Add the component to exports in packages/ui/package.json
- Create apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx
- Export a default component that uses the  @repo/ui/admin component
- Run npm run dev (either in root or in apps/web ) and try to see the website

>
You can also use the packages/ui/turbo/generators to quickly bootstrap a new component
Try running npx gen react-component and notice it’ll do step 1, 2, 3 for you in one cli call

### Adding React projects
- Go to the apps folder
"cd apps"
- Create a fresh vite app
"npm create vite@latest "
- Update package.json to include @repo/ui as a dependency
"@repo/ui": "*",
- Run npm install in the root folder

- Try importing something from the ui package and rendering it
Add a turbo.json to the react folder to override the outputs object of this module. 
Ref https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/configuring-workspaces
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}

#### Caching in Turborepo
- One of the big things that make turborepo fast and efficient is caching
- It watches your files across builds and returns the cached response of builds if no files have changed.
- You can also explore the node_modules/.cache/turbo folder to see the zipped cache files and unzip them using
"tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xvf name.tar.zst"


### Adding nodejs projects
- Everything else remains the same (Create a new project, add typescript, add express…)
- The only thing that’s different is that tsc doesn’t perform great with turborepo
- You can use either tsup or esbuild for building your backend application
 
- Create apps/backend
- Initialize empty ts repo
"npm init -y"
"npx tsc --init"

Use base tsconfig  (Ref - https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/examples/kitchen-sink/apps/api/tsconfig.json )

{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2015"],
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": ["."]
}

- Add dependencies
"npm i express @types/express"
- Add src/index.ts

Update turbo.json
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}

- Install esbuild
"npm install esbuild"
- Add build script to package.json
"build": "esbuild src/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --outdir=dist"
 
When initializing typescript in nodejs module, you have to make some changes in it to make it work in a monorepo.
When we are making a nodejs module then in that tsconfig file we need to change things. You can go to turbo website and see example codebase and in that see any project's react backend and get tsconfig code from that example and put in your nodejs module tsconfig...


### Adding a common module
A lot of times you need a module that can be shared by both frontend and backend apps

- Initialize a packages/common module
"cd packages"
"mkdir common"
- Initialize an empty node.js project
"npm init -y"
"npx tsc --init"
- Change the name to @repo/common
- Export a few things from src/index.ts
- export const NUMBER = 1;
- Add it to the package.json of various apps (next app/react app/node app)
"@repo/common": "*",

- Import it in there and try to use it
- Run npm install in root folder and see if it works as expected.
