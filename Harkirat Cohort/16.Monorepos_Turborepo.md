# Monorepos:
A single repository (on github lets say) that holds all your frontend, backend, devops code.
Need to know?
Not exactly. Most of the times they are setup in the project already by the dev tools guy and you just need to follow the right practices to work with it.

Why cant I just store services (backend, frontend etc) in various top level folders?
You can, and you should if your:
- Services are highly decoupled (dont share any code)
- Services don‚Äôt depend on each other.

For eg - A codebase which has a Golang service and a JS service


**Why monorepos?**
- Shared Code Reuse
- Enhanced Collaboration
- Optimized Builds and CI/CD: Tools like TurboRepo offer smart caching and task execution strategies that can significantly reduce build and testing times.
- Centralized Tooling and Configuration: Managing build tools, linters, formatters, and other configurations is simpler in a monorepo because you can have a single set of tools for the entire project.

Common monorepos frameworks: Lerna, nx, Turborepo(its not exactly a monorepo framework`), Yarn/npm workspace

The difference between **npm** and **pnpm** lies in how they **install**, **store**, and **manage** packages ‚Äî which significantly affects **performance**, **disk space**, and **dependency management**.

## Core Differences Explained

### 1. **Performance**

* **npm** installs all dependencies by downloading and copying them to the `node_modules` folder of each project.
* **pnpm** downloads packages once and **creates hard links** from a **global content-addressable store** ‚Äî meaning it reuses the same package across projects without duplication.

### 2. **node\_modules Structure**

* **npm** uses a flat structure, which can sometimes cause hidden dependency issues.
* **pnpm** uses a **strict, symlink-based layout** which mirrors how Node.js actually resolves modules. This helps catch bugs early (e.g., using packages not listed in `package.json`).

### 3. **Disk Space Usage**

* With **npm**, multiple projects may each store their own copies of the same packages.
* **pnpm** saves a **lot** of disk space by storing each package version **once globally** and linking it.

### 4. **Strict Dependency Resolution**

* **pnpm** enforces **"no phantom dependencies"** ‚Äî you can‚Äôt use a package unless it‚Äôs declared in your `package.json`.
* **npm** is more lenient; it might let you use a package that's actually a transitive dependency of another.

---

## Which One Should You Use?

* Use **pnpm** if:

  * You want faster installs and builds
  * You‚Äôre working in a **monorepo**
  * You want better disk usage and stricter dependency rules

* Stick with **npm** if:

  * You‚Äôre working on a simple project and prefer the default
  * You need compatibility with older scripts/tools not yet adapted to `pnpm`

- **Bonus**: You Can Use Both, they work with the same `package.json`.

#### Build System
A build system automates the process of transforming source code written by developers into binary code that can be executed by a computer. For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, this process can include transpilation (converting TS to JS eg: tsc), bundling (combining multiple files into fewer files eg: vite), minification (reducing file size), and more.

#### Monorepo Framework
A monorepo framework provides tools and conventions for managing projects that contain multiple packages or applications within a single repository (monorepo). This includes dependency management between packages, workspace configuration.

It has nothing to do with a build systems. The monorepo frameworks makes the imports slightly cleaner, it lets you import things from one module to another module without pushing them to npm.

#### Build System Orchestrator
TurboRepo acts more like a build system orchestrator rather than a direct build system itself. It doesn't directly perform tasks like transpilation, bundling, minification, or running tests. Instead, TurboRepo allows you to define tasks in your monorepo that call other tools (which are the actual build systems) to perform these actions. 
These tools can include anything from tsc, vite etc.
Turborepo orchestrates the builds, lets say a project has frontend, backend and common repos, then fe and be depends on common then turborepo builds the common first and then it builds the fe and be parallely. It lets schedule these builds a certain way and it also parallelise them.

The key feature of TurboRepo is its ability to manage and optimize the execution of these tasks across your monorepo. It does this through: </br>
**Caching**: TurboRepo caches the outputs of tasks, so if you run a task and then run it again without changing any of the inputs (source files, dependencies, configuration), TurboRepo can skip the actual execution and provide the output from the cache. This can significantly speed up build times, especially in continuous integration environments. </br>
**Parallelization**: It can run independent tasks in parallel, making efficient use of your machine's resources. This reduces the overall time needed to complete all tasks in your project.</br>
**Dependency Graph Awareness**: TurboRepo understands the dependency graph of your monorepo. This means it knows which packages depend on each other and can ensure tasks are run in the correct order. </br>

>Is turborepo relevant if we use nextjs?
If you only use nextjs then no. If you use next with an express server or websocket server or something else, then yes.

### Folder structure
- End user apps (websites/core backend)
  - apps/web - A Next.js website
  - apps/docs - A Docs website that has all the documentation related to your project
- Helper packages
  - packages/ui - UI packages 
  - packages/typescript-config - Shareable TS configuration
  - packages/eslint-config - Shareable ESLine configuration 


To run the project run this in root folder: `npm run dev` </br>
You will notice two websites running on :
- localhost:3000
- localhost:3001

This means we have a single repo which has multiple projects which share code from packages/ui.</br>
Root package.json represents what command runs, when you run `turbo build`, then it goes into all packages and apps and runs `npm run build` inside them (provided they have it) Same for dev and lint. Thats the turborepo part.</br>
Then there is workspaces, it specifies lets say 2 workspaces apps and packages, means these are the two places where you will find things that you need to share code among each other. This workspaces part is not turborepo its the npm workspaces.


Lets see packages:</br>
When we see package.json of ui then we can see there name is like @repo/ui, so try to make it unique by prepending it with project name. Then you can see exports section, in which you have to export the components (like: "./button": "./src/button.tsx",) that you will be using in the repos like import Button from @repo/ui/button... You have to do this, you can have a single export as index.js and then in that index file there you can have all the export statements.

In app/web folder: </br>
- Dependencies: It is a simple next.js app.
- package.json: If you explore package.json of apps/web, you will notice @repo/ui as a dependency too (If you want to use that UI components you have to add that UI package as dependency like "@repo/ui" : "*"), so that you can seamlessly import components from the ui repo.
Like there is a Button component in the ui folder then you can use that button component in both the web and docs module.

>What is the advantage of using multiple repos?
Deployment becomes easy here, but in turborepo deployment is a mess. One change in fe and deploy then all the code including backend and all will be redeployed.

How to configure tailwind and shadcn in turborepo?</br>
- You have to use hack like this, which is used by 100xdevs code github, put this in the apps/frontend/tailwind.config.js
{
  content: [
    "../../packages/ui/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./screens/**/*{.ts,tsx}",
  ]
}

#### EXTRAS: `Remote Caching`
What happens is when you have app in github, when you push on github repo, the commit then first build somewhere, it builds in a github machine and a js file is created, and then this js files reaches the ec2 machine where youve deployed the code.
When youre pushing the code a lot of time youre not changing in a particular folder, youre changing somewhere else, but this build happens again, what remote caching is it will store the js bundle somewhere on s3 so that if the code hasnt changed then it will use the cached bundle and send it to the ec2 server. It dont build again. It doesnt been used until you have a 100 people commit everyday. So the remote caching is a main thing for turborepo, i guess it makes money from this.

**Let‚Äôs add a new page:**
- Try adding a new page to /admin to the apps/web next.js website.
- It should use a simple Admin component from packages/ui
- Steps to follow - 
  - Create a new file admin.tsx inside packages/ui/src
  - Export a simple React component

```tsx
"use client";

export const Admin = () => {
  return (
    <h1>
        hi from admin component
    </h1>
  );
};
```
- Add the component to exports in packages/ui/package.json
```json
"exports": {
  "./admin": "./src/admin.tsx",
  ...
}
```
- Create apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx
- Export a default component that uses the `@repo/ui/admin` component
- Run npm run dev (either in root or in apps/web ) and try to see the website

So you define a component once and you can use that component in multiple frontends.

1. It would be nice if you added a file in ui/turbo and run a single script which add a file in src and updated the package.json. So in ui's package.json you can see there is a generate:component script. Run this in the package/ui folder and you'll see there is a new component created in src and the package.json is updated with the new component export.
2. So you can use this script to quickly add a new component in the ui package.
```bash
npm run generate:component -- --name=admin
```
3. You can also use the packages/ui/turbo/generators to quickly bootstrap a new component in the ui package. This is a custom generator that uses the `plop` library to generate a new component with the necessary boilerplate code and updates the package.json exports automatically.
4. So you can run this command in the ui package to generate a new component:
```bash
npx plop generate:component --name=admin
```
5. Try running npx gen react-component and notice it‚Äôll do step 1, 2 for you in one cli call
```bash
npx gen react-component --name=admin
```


Exploring turbo.json:</br>
Ref - https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new#3-understanding-turbojson</br>
References - https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/configuration#globaldependencies</br>
Like there are turbo build, turbo dev scripts in package.json then in the turbo.json you tell what turborepo should do with this scripts. There it has pipelines and in there written where to go to run those commands as in like in turbo.json there is written ^build which means go to every folder and in there package.json if written build script then it builds there. Now in outputs, there's written to cache these folders. So these outputs is for the next apps there. If we make a new express or some other app then we have to make changes in the pipeline accordingly.
Then in dev we have made cache false, persistent true which means if we run in dev mode then we dont want all the next app to depend on somethings. So we make persistent false.


### Adding React projects
- Go to the apps folder `cd apps`
- Create a fresh vite app `npm create vite@latest`
- Update package.json to include @repo/ui as a dependency, make it a habit in every fe app `@repo/ui": "*",`
- Run `npm install` in the root folder

- Try importing something from the ui package and rendering it</br>
Add a turbo.json to the react folder to override the outputs object of this module. 
Ref https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/configuring-workspaces
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}

#### Caching in Turborepo
- One of the big things that make turborepo fast and efficient is caching
- It watches your files across builds and returns the cached response of builds if no files have changed.
- You can also explore the node_modules/.cache/turbo folder to see the zipped cache files and unzip them using</br>
`tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xvf name.tar.zst`


## Adding nodejs projects
- Everything else remains the same (Create a new project, add typescript, add express‚Ä¶)
- The only thing that‚Äôs different is that tsc doesn‚Äôt perform great with turborepo
- You can use either tsup or esbuild for building your backend application
- Create apps/backend
- Initialize empty ts repo
```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

>Now you know you need to extend the ts config of base.json, but you need to override few things like its in the nextjs app's tsconfig file, now how do you know what to override in this project. You go to kitchensink repo which you can find at turbo official website, go to examples and see an example of that particlar framework. There kitchensink is a good example as it has a react fe app and there is a express app, so from there you can find out the tsconfig.

Use base tsconfig  (Ref - https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/examples/kitchen-sink/apps/api/tsconfig.json )
```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2015"],
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": ["."]
}
```

- Add dependencies
```bash
npm i express @types/express
```
- Add src/index.ts
- Add build and dev scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "esbuild src/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --outdir=dist",
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts"
  }
}
```
- Update turbo.json
```json
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Install esbuild
```bash
npm install esbuild
```
- Add build script to package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "esbuild src/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --outdir=dist",
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts"
  }
}
```
- Run `npm run build` to build the backend application
- Run `npm run dev` to start the backend application in development mode
When initializing typescript in nodejs module, you have to make some changes in it to make it work in a monorepo.
When we are making a nodejs module then in that tsconfig file we need to change things. You can go to turbo website and see example codebase and in that see any project's react backend and get tsconfig code from that example and put in your nodejs module tsconfig...


## Adding a common module
A lot of times you need a module that can be shared by both frontend and backend apps

- Initialize a packages/common module
```bash
cd packages
mkdir common
```
- Initialize an empty node.js project
```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```
- Change the name to @repo/common
- Export a few things from src/index.ts
- export const NUMBER = 1;
- Add it to the package.json of various apps (next app/react app/node app) `@repo/common": "*",`
- And then run a global `npm install`, it will bring the package over to the root node_modules.
- Import it in there and try to use it
- See there will be an error, always, as there is something wrong with the tsconfig.json
- If you get the tsconfig content from some repo like kitchensink example present in the official turbo website then too this error will come.
- So in here the error can be fixed by not using tsc compliler rather using other compiler, tsup or esbuild.
- So do `npm i esbuild`
- Then instead of `tsc -b` and `node dist/index.js`
- You can do `npx esbuild ./src/index.ts --bundle --platform=node --outfile=dist/index.js` this command converts the typescript code into js
- Then run `node dist/index.js`
- This works, and now put that to the script in the package.json file.
- If you want you can try to run tsup for this too. Get the tsup config file content from internet and use it too.

FIX: So in common, package.json we should not export a .js file, rather we should export a .ts file.

While using tsc issue came is:
```bash
npm tsc -b
node dist/index.js
```
- export const VALUE = "Im th best"
- SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'
