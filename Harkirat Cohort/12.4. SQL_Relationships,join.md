Why not noSql?
- Can lead to inconsistent database
- Can cause runtime errors 
- Is too flexible for an app that needs strictness
- Can get bad at scale
Upsides: - You can move very fast - Can change schema very easily

Why SQL?
SQL databases have a strict schema. They require you to
- Define your schema
- Put in data that follows that schema
- Update the schema as your app changes and perform migrations


So there are 4 parts when using an SQL database (not connecting it to Node.js, just running it and putting data in it)
- Running the database.
- Using a library that let’s you connect and put data in it.
- Creating a table and defining it’s schema.
- Run queries on the database to interact with the data (Insert/Update/Delete)

You can create a database using db service like neon db and get a connection string, or you can use docker to make a database container.


Using a library that let’s you connect and put data in it.
1. psql
psql is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It provides an interactive command-line interface to the PostgreSQL database. With psql, you can type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.

How to connect to your database?
psql comes bundled with postgresql.
"psql -h p-broken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech -d database1 -U 100xdevs"
psql -h host_name -d database_name -U user_name

 
2. pg
pg is a Node.js library that you can use in your backend app to store data in the Postgres DB (similar to mongoose).
Just like mongoose exists for mongoDB, pg exists for postgres. It lets you put data inside database by using nodejs backend app.
>
Postgres also have a gui like mongo its pgadmin.

**Creating a table and defining its schema**
A single database can have multiple tables inside. Think of them as collections in a MongoDB database. The next step in case of postgres is to define the schema of your tables.
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```


There are 4 things you’d like to do with a database 
 
1. INSERT
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('username_here', 'user@example.com', 'user_password');
```
2. UPDATE
```sql
UPDATE users
SET password = 'new_password'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```
3. DELETE
```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```
4. Select
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

now to insert the users into the table, write the queries in the tilde symbol. And you can use ${} to inject variables.
Now you should not directly use this as there is a danger of SQL injection by the user. You should use $1 $2 $3 and pass values as array to avoid the vulnerability.
eg:
(`INSERT INTO users (username, password, email)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3)`, [username, password, email])

 
## Relationships in SQL
Address table is related to the users table. When defining the table, you need to define the relationship.
When you insert address, if youve told sql that userid is foreign key to the user table id, sql make sure you cannot put userid that dont exist on user table id.
Eg:
```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE addresses (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        pincode VARCHAR(20),
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );
```

ON DELETE CASCADE means any time the user entry is deleted, cascade the delete to anything that references it so that the data is cleaned up very well.
ON DELETE RESTRICT means it will not let delete the user with id if someone is referencing it from other table. Restricted the deletion of address if something references the address. So you have to delete from address then you can delete from the user table.


## Transactions in SQL
Whenever you are doing transactions, whenever youre doing multiple things togeather that you want either all of them to work or if either one of them fails, all of them to roll back.

>
Good question to have at this point is what queries are run when the user signs up and sends both their information and their addresses in the single request? Do we send two SQL queries into the database? What if one of the queries (address queries for example) fails? 
This would require `transactions` in sql to ensure either both the user information and address goes in or neither does
>

```sql
    BEGIN; -- Start transaction

    INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
    VALUES ('john_doe', 'john_doe1@example.com', 'securepassword123');

    INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street, pincode)
    VALUES (currval('users_id_seq'), 'New York', 'USA', '123 Broadway St', '10001');

    COMMIT;
```
Nodejs code, check it out!!
```js
    try{
        await client.connect();

        // Start transaction
        await client.query('BEGIN');

        // Insert user
        const insertUserText = `
            INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
            VALUES ($1, $2, $3)
            RETURNING id;
        `;
        const userRes = await client.query(insertUserText, [username, email, password]);
        const userId = userRes.rows[0].id;

        // Insert address using the returned user ID
        const insertAddressText = `
            INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street, pincode)
            VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5);
        `;
        await client.query(insertAddressText, [userId, city, country, street, pincode]);

        // Commit transaction
        await client.query('COMMIT');

        console.log('User and address inserted successfully');
    } catch (err) {
        await client.query('ROLLBACK'); // Roll back the transaction on error
        console.error('Error during transaction, rolled back.', err);
        throw err;
    } finally {
        await client.end(); // Close the client connection
    }
```


## Joining SQL
Defining relationships is easy. What’s hard is joining data from two (or more) tables together.
Benefits of using a join - 
- Reduced Latency
- Simplified Application Logic
- Transactional Integrity

For example, if I ask you to fetch me a users details and  their address, what SQL would you run? Like give a user's username, email and passowrd and give me their address details. This way we are doing two round trips to the database, which is bad. And what if you run a data query and the database changes and then you run the address data query. There is no integrity in your request. There is no way for you to know When you send back a req for user and got back the data, before you send the address req, something might have chnaged.
```sql
-- Query 1: Fetch user's details
SELECT id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE id = your_user_id;

-- Query 2: Fetch user's address
SELECT city, country, street, pincode
FROM addresses
WHERE user_id = your_user_id;
```

So there is an good approach(JOINS):

```sql
    SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, a.city, a.country, a.street, a.pincode
    FROM users u
    JOIN addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
    WHERE u.id = YOUR_USER_ID;
```
Nodejs code for that:
```js
import { Client } from 'pg';

// Async function to fetch user data and their address together
async function getUserDetailsWithAddress(userId: string) {
    const client = new Client({
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 5432,
        database: 'postgres',
        user: 'postgres',
        password: 'mysecretpassword',
    });

    try {
        await client.connect();
        const query = `
            SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, a.city, a.country, a.street, a.pincode
            FROM users u
            JOIN addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
            WHERE u.id = $1
        `;
        const result = await client.query(query, [userId]);

        if (result.rows.length > 0) {
            console.log('User and address found:', result.rows[0]);
            return result.rows[0];
        } else {
            console.log('No user or address found with the given ID.');
            return null;
        }
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error during fetching user and address:', err);
        throw err;
    } finally {
        await client.end();
    }
}
getUserDetailsWithAddress("1");
```


Types of Joins
1. INNER JOIN
Returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables. If there is no match, the rows are not returned. It's the most common type of join.
Use Case: Find All Users With Their Addresses. If a user hasn’t filled their address, that user shouldn’t be returned
```sql
    SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
    FROM users
    INNER JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```
2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table.
Use case - To list all users from your database along with their address information (if they've provided it), you'd use a LEFT JOIN. Users without an address will still appear in your query result, but the address fields will be NULL for them.
```sql
    SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
    FROM users
    LEFT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```
3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table.
Use case - Given the structure of the database, a RIGHT JOIN would be less common since the addresses table is unlikely to have entries not linked to a user due to the foreign key constraint. However, if you had a situation where you start with the addresses table and optionally include user information, this would be the theoretical use case.
```sql
    SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
    FROM users
    RIGHT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```
4. FULL JOIN
Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. It effectively combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.
Use case - A FULL JOIN would combine all records from both users and addresses, showing the relationship where it exists. Given the constraints, this might not be as relevant because every address should be linked to a user, but if there were somehow orphaned records on either side, this query would reveal them.
```sql
    SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
    FROM users
    FULL JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```
