# React Foundations

- React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates and improve performance. The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements. It's a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
- When you make changes to the state of a React component, React creates a new virtual DOM tree representing the updated state.
- React then compares the new virtual DOM with the previous virtual DOM to determine the differences (diffing).
- The differences are used to compute the most efficient way to update the real DOM.
- The real DOM is the actual browser's Document Object Model, representing the structure of the HTML document.
- When React determines the updates needed based on the virtual DOM diffing process, it updates the real DOM with only the necessary changes.
- Manipulating the real DOM can be expensive in terms of performance, so React aims to minimize direct interaction with it.


When React determines the updates needed based on the virtual DOM diffing process, it updates the real DOM with only the necessary changes.

> In summary, while there are two representations— virtual DOM and real DOM. React abstracts the complexity of direct manipulation of the real DOM by using a virtual DOM and efficiently updating only the parts that have changed. This approach contributes to React's efficiency and performance in managing UI updates.

In React, when the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect that change. This way, your users always see the most up-to-date and accurate information on the screen.


# React Props

In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow you to customize and configure child components based on values provided by their parent components.

- Props in React are read-only. A child component cannot modify the props it receives from a parent. Props are intended to be immutable.
- You can provide default values for props to ensure that the component works even if certain props are not explicitly passed.
- You can pass functions as props, allowing child components to communicate with their parent components.
