# Docker
Docker let’s you:
- Containerise your applications: Package applications and their dependencies into a portable container.
- Run other’s code and packages: Easily execute pre-packaged applications on your machine.
- Run common software packages inside a container: For eg - Mongo, Postgre, etc,

## **Container and Image**  

- A **container** is like a mini computer inside your machine. It has:  
    - Its own **file system**  
    - Its own **network**  
    - Its own **ports**  

- Example Use Case:  
    Instead of running `node index.js` or `python a.py` natively, you can run them inside a container.  

- **Images and Containers:**  
    - An **image** is like a blueprint of your application or software.  
    - Image in execution is what is called a container.<br/>

Where can we get packages from?<br/>
Just like you can push your code to Github, you can push images to docker registries.<br/>
eg: docker pull mongo<br/>

## **Common Commands**  

### 1. **Running a Simple Image**  
- Basic command:  
  ```bash
  docker run mongo
  ```  
  **Problem:** You can't connect MongoDB Compass because no port mapping is specified.  

- **Port Mapping:**  
  ```bash
  docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo
  ```  
  Maps your machine's port `27017` to the container's port `27017`.  

- **Running in Detached Mode:**  
  Use `-d` to run the container in the background:  
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
  ```  

### 2. **Inspecting a Container**  
- List running containers:  
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```  

### 3. **Stopping a Container**  
- Stop a container:  
  ```bash
  docker kill <container_id>
  ```


**To run the PostgreSQL with Docker:**<br/>
`docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`, -e means environment variable.<br/>
The **connection string** for this postgres would be <br/>
`postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres`
The name of the db will be postgres by default, if you want to name the db then:<br/>
`docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_USER=varun -d -p 5432:5432 postgres` <br/>
then the connection string will be:<br/>
`postgresql://varun:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/varun`

1. **Dockerfile**: Mention the concept of a Dockerfile, which allows you to define how to build a custom image. It contains instructions on how to set up your application environment, including the base image, dependencies, and configuration.

2. **Volumes**: Docker volumes, which are used for persistent data storage.

eg: `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo`

3. **Networks**: Introduce Docker networks, which allow you to connect multiple containers together. You can create a bridge network for containers to communicate with each other.

4. **Docker Compose**: Briefly mention Docker Compose for running multi-container applications using a docker-compose.yml file. This simplifies managing services and their dependencies.

5. Common Commands: 
Include additional commands like:<br/>
docker stop <container_id>: Gracefully stops a running container.<br/>
docker rm <container_id>: Removes a stopped container.<br/>
docker rmi <image_name>: Removes an image from your local machine.<br/>
docker logs <container_id>: View the logs of a container.<br/>

6. **Docker Hub**: Docker Hub is the default registry where you can find and share container images. You might want to include how to create a Docker Hub account for pushing your own images.

7. Best Practices: 
    - Optimize Image Size, Use lightweight base images (e.g., `alpine`), Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
    - Multi-stage builds: Build only what you need for production, reducing image size.

8. Security Considerations: Using trusted base images, regularly scanning images for vulnerabilities, and running containers with the least privileges required.
