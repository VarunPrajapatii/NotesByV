# Docker
Docker let’s you:
- containerise your applications.
- run other people’s code + packages in your machine.
- run common software packages inside a container  (For eg - Mongo, Postgres etc)

**Container and Image**
We run node index.js or python a.py these natively or we can run them in container. You can think of container as mini computer inside our computer. It has its own file system, 
it has its own network, its own ports...
We can start continer of postgres or mongodb etc and run them locally and start them on some port in that container.

Where can we get packages from?
Just like you can push your code to Github, you can push images to docker registries.
So we download image of Mongodb or image of postgres by running a command of that image in aur machine and run them in a container.
eg: docker pull mongo
So, you can get an image from docker hub and when you start it then you can say youve started a container.
Image in execution is what is called a container.

**Common commands to know**
1. Running a simple image
eg: "docker run mongo"
- You will notice you can’t open it in MongoDB Compass, Because you havent told it to give all the requests coming to your computer's port 27017 to container's 27017.
- So, you have to add port mapping
"docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo"
- Now requests coming to computer's 27017 will get routed to container's 27017.
- Starting in detached mode. Adding -d will ensure it starts in the background
"docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo"

2. Inspecting a container
"docker ps" - This will show you all the containers you are running.

3. Stopping a container
"docker kill <container_id>"- This will stop the container that you are running


To run the postgres:
"docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres"
-e means environment variable.

The connection string for this postgres would be 
"postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres"
The name of the db will be postgres by default, if you want to name the db then:
"docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGES_USER=varun -d -p 5432:5432 postgres"
then the connection string will be:
"postgresql://varun:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/varun"

You can read this in the documentation of the image in docker hub...
