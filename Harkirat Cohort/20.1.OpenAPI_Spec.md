## OpenAPI
Its pretty useful if youre thinking of building a website where youre want other developers to directly hit your backend servers.
The app's FE sends to BE but here other devs can also hit that backend. When you expose them your apis and a very clean documentation page.
If you want to do use some service of an app programmatically without going through their ui you can use it by sending up req to their endpoint with that body.
When you create a backend it's very hard for other people to know the exact shape of your routes without wouldn't it be nice if you could describe, in a single file the shape of your routes. When youre building systems like these, where you allow other people to directly hit your backend, you have to expose them you apis and a very clean documentation page.
You create a single OpenAPI Spec file that describes every end point of your nodejs server and give it to developers. Why not the docs page? Because if you have that file then you can always auto generate a docs page.
If you have this single long file that lists all your routes, you could
    - Auto generate documentation pages (Ref https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#query-current-order-count-usage-trade)
    - Auto generate clients in various languages (Java, JS, Goâ€¦)
    - Let the world look at your API routes shape without actually opening your code
    - Let AIs know how to hit your APIs in a single file, without sharing your code with the AI


**OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**: The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code, additional documentation, or network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with minimal implementation logic.
Here's a small file example:

```ts
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

let users = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe' }
];

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    const { name } = req.query;

    if (name) {
        const filteredUsers = users.filter(user => user.name.toLowerCase().includes(name.toLowerCase()));
        res.json(filteredUsers);
    } else {
        res.json(users);
    }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

The OpenAPI Spec file of above code looks like this:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User API
  description: API to manage users
  version: "1.0.0"
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:3000
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Get a list of users
      description: Retrieves a list of users, optionally filtered by name.
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: name
          schema:
            type: string
          required: false
          description: Name filter for user lookup.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A list of users
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
          description: The unique identifier of the user.
        name:
          type: string
          description: The name of the user.
      required:
        - id
        - name
```

Give this file you can generate the documentations, swaggar page
Try visiting:
http://localhost:3000/users?name=John Doe,a,http://localhost:3000/users?name=John%20Doe


#### To create Swagger in this app:
- npm i swagger-ui-express
- npm i -D @types/swagger-ui-express
- Add these in index.ts file:

```ts
import swaggerUi from 'swagger-ui-express';
import { OpenAPISpec } from './openapiSpec'
// OpenAPISpec contains the json converted yaml file code in a variable called OpenAPISpec, as this wants the spec in json, as far as googling an article says, you can research more on how to make it take the yaml file.
app.use('/documentation', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(OpenAPISpec));

```

#### To create a OpenAPI Spec file:
- Write it by hand (bad, but still happens)
- Auto generate it from your code 
    - Easy in languages that have deep types like Rust
    - Slightly harder in languages like Go/Javascript
    - Node.js has some libraries/codebases that let you do it
        - With express - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-openapi (highly verbose)
        - Without express - https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa (Cohort 1 video)
    - Hono has a native implementation with zod - https://hono.dev/snippets/zod-openapi


**Parts of the Spec file**: Focus on all your paths and all schemas that are assiciated to paths. Paths are all of the routes, schemas are all of the shapes of the inputs, the outputs that you want extracted out so that you can reuse them in various paths.

Lets see how to create http endpoint with auto-generated OpenAPI Spec using zod OpenAPI. REF: https://hono.dev/examples/zod-openapi
