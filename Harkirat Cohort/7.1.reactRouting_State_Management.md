## React Routing
- In traditional web development, navigating between pages required a full page reload. React, being a Single Page Application (SPA) library, loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as users navigate. Routing enables SPAs to mimic the behavior of traditional MPAs by updating the view based on the URL.

React Router provides a set of components and functions to define routes, handle navigation, and manage the application's history, making it an essential tool for building robust and navigable React applications.

- A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server.
- A client-side bundle refers to a collection of JavaScript files and other assets bundled together to be delivered to the client's web browser.
- Client-side routing refers to the process of managing navigation within a Single Page Application (SPA) entirely on the client side, without making additional requests to the server for each new view.

### React Router DOM
- The BrowserRouter component is a top-level component that should be used to wrap your entire application.
- The Routes component is used to define the routes for your application. Inside the Routes component, you specify individual Route components for each route in your application.
- The Route component is responsible for rendering specific components based on the current URL path. It takes two main props: path and element.

This is a basic setup for using React Router DOM. You can extend this by adding nested routes, handling dynamic route parameters, and incorporating additional features provided by React Router DOM for more advanced routing scenarios.
>
When using window.location.href(window.location.href = “/dashboard” this global location object is you have access inside our dom) for navigation in a React application, it triggers a full page reload/refresh, which is not desirable in client-side routing.
To address this issue, React Router DOM provides a solution in the form of the useNavigate hook(const navigate = useNavigate(“/dashboard”)). This hook is designed for programmatic navigation within a React component without triggering a full page reload. You have to use this inside the component that are inside the BrowserRouter.

### Lazy Loading
Lazy loading in React is a technique used to optimize the performance of a web application by deferring the loading of certain components until they are actually needed.
React.lazy function allows you to load a component lazily, meaning it is only fetched when the component is actually rendered.
When you're using React.lazy to load a component lazily, you wrap it with Suspense to specify a fallback UI that will be rendered while the component is being loaded. The fallback prop of Suspense defines what to display during the loading period.

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

    const MyLazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

    function App() {
        return (
            <div>
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <MyLazyComponent />
            </Suspense>
            </div>
        );
    }
```
This mechanism is particularly useful for improving the user experience when dealing with dynamic loading of components or fetching data asynchronously. The fallback UI gives users feedback that something is happening in the background, making the application feel more responsive.


### Why Prop Drilling?
**State Management** - Prop drilling is often used to manage state in a React application. By passing state down through the component tree, you can share data between components without resorting to more advanced state management solutions like context or state management libraries.
Simplicity - Prop drilling keeps the application structure simple and makes it easier to understand the flow of data. It's a straightforward way of handling data without introducing more complex tools.
When it comes to many levels of passing props through components, the code becomes degraded with less readibility, maintainability, increased complexity.

Prop drilling is not a bad practice because its causing rerenders it’s a bad thing because its making code becomes visually unappealing to look at.

In React and other frontend frameworks, there are various methods to manage state:
1. **Local Component State:**
    - Each component in React can have its own local state managed using the `useState` hook.
    - Local state is confined to the component it belongs to and is primarily used for managing component-specific data.
2. **Context API:**
    - React provides the Context API to manage global state that needs to be accessed by multiple components.
    - It allows the sharing of state across the component tree without having to pass props manually through each level.
3. **State Management Libraries (e.g., Redux, Recoil):**
    - Specialized state management libraries offer advanced features for handling complex global state in large applications.
    - These libraries often introduce concepts like actions, reducers, and a centralized store for maintaining state.
The choice of state management method depends on the complexity and requirements of the application. Effective state management enhances the predictability, maintainability, and scalability of the application, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Context API in React
Context API is a feature provided by React that allows components to share state without prop drilling. It creates a context and a provider to wrap components that need access to that context. Context api isn’t for making your code performant it’s just to make your code cleaner to look at. For making the code performant there are state management tools.

``` jsx
    // Create a context
    const UserContext = React.createContext();

    // Top-level component with a Provider
    function App() {
        const user = { username: "john_doe", role: "user" };

        return (
            <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
            <Profile />
            </UserContext.Provider>
        );
    }

    // Intermediate component
    function Profile() {
        return <Navbar />;
    }

    // Deepest component consuming the context value
    function Navbar() {
        const user = useContext(UserContext);

        return (
            <nav>
            <p>Welcome, {user.username} ({user.role})</p>
            </nav>
        );
    }
```
In this example, the UserContext.Provider in the App component provides the user object to all its descendants. The Navbar component, which is deeply nested, consumes the user context value without the need for prop drilling.
It allows you to manage global state that can be accessed by components across the application.


## Recoil
- Recoil is a state management library developed by Facebook for React applications. It introduces the concept of atoms and selectors to manage state globally.

```jsx
    // Atom creation
    import { atom, useRecoilState } from 'recoil';

    export const userState = atom({
        key: 'userState',
        default: { name: 'John' },
    });

    // Accessing Recoil state in a component
    function Profile() {
        const [user, setUser] = useRecoilState(userState);

        return (
            <div>
            <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Jane' })}>Change Name</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
```



## Redux
- Redux is a powerful state management library often used with React. It introduces a global store and follows a unidirectional data flow, it comes with additional concepts and boilerplate. 

```jsx
    // Store creation
    import { createStore } from 'redux';

    const initialState = { user: { name: 'John' } };

    const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'CHANGE_NAME':
            return { ...state, user: { name: 'Jane' } };
            default:
            return state;
        }
    };

    const store = createStore(rootReducer);

    // Accessing Redux state in a component
    function Profile() {
        const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);
        const dispatch = useDispatch();

        return (
            <div>
            <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'CHANGE_NAME' })}>Change Name</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
```
THAT WAS THE OLD Redux syntax. Now in modern syntax we use redux toolkit.
```js
{
    // store.js
    import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

    // Create a slice (which includes reducer and actions)
    const userSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'user',
        initialState: { name: 'John' },
        reducers: {
            changeName: (state, action) => {
            state.name = action.payload;
            },
        },
    });

    // Export actions
    export const { changeName } = userSlice.actions;

    // Create and export the store
    const store = configureStore({
        reducer: {
            user: userSlice.reducer,
        },
    });

    export default store;
}

{
    // Profile.js
    import React from 'react';
    import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
    import { changeName } from './store'; // Import the action

    function Profile() {
        const user = useSelector((state) => state.user); // Access state
        const dispatch = useDispatch();

        return (
            <div>
            <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(changeName('Jane'))}>Change Name</button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default Profile;
}
```



#### **Considerations:**

- **Complexity:** Context API is simple and built into React, making it a good choice for simpler state management. Recoil provides more features and optimizations, while Redux is powerful but comes with additional complexity.
- **Scalability:** Recoil and Redux are often preferred for larger applications due to their ability to manage complex state logic.
- **Community Support:** Redux has a large and established community with a wide range of middleware and tools. Recoil is newer but gaining popularity, while Context API is part of the React core.

#### **Choosing Between Them:**
- **Use Context API for Simplicity:** For simpler state management needs, especially in smaller applications or when simplicity is a priority.
- **Consider Recoil for Advanced Features:** When advanced state management features, like selectors and performance optimizations, are needed.
- **Opt for Redux for Scalability:** In larger applications where scalability, middleware, and a broader ecosystem are important factors.
