# Prisma

## ORM
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks provide a bridge between the object-oriented world of application development and the relational world of databases.

ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems using object-oriented programming languages, developers can interact with using their programming language instead of direct database queries.
ORMs let you easily interact with your database without worrying too much about the underlying syntax (SQL language for eg)



## Prisma as a ORM
- Prisma uses a declarative Prisma schema to define the application's data model.
- Prisma Migrate allows developers to define and perform database schema migrations in a controlled and versioned manner.
- Prisma Client provides a fluent API for building queries, which can be more intuitive than writing raw SQL, especially for complex queries.



- **Syntax**
Eg:
SQL
```jsx
    INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```
Prisma
```jsx
    await prisma.users.create({
        data: {
            name: 'John Doe',
            email: 'john@example.com',
        },
    });
```
Eg:
SQL
```jsx
    const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1'
    const result = await client.query(query, ["varun@mail.com"])
```
Prisma
```jsx
    User.find({
        email: "varun@mail.com"
    })
```


Here are some key points to remember when comparing SQL syntax with Prisma:

1. Abstraction Level
    - **SQL**: Directly interacts with the database using SQL queries. This requires knowledge of SQL syntax and potential database-specific nuances.
    - **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that abstracts the database interaction, allowing you to use JavaScript/TypeScript objects instead of raw SQL. This can simplify database operations and make your code cleaner.
2. Data Manipulation
    - **Insertions**: 
        - SQL requires you to specify the table and columns directly.
        - Prisma uses methods like create that take an object, making it easier to handle and read.
    - **Queries**: 
        - In SQL, you construct the query string and pass parameters, which can lead to SQL injection if not handled properly.
        - In Prisma, you use method calls (e.g., find), which provide built-in safety against SQL injection and often include type checking.
3. Readability and Maintainability
    - **SQL**: Queries can become lengthy and complex, especially for joins and subqueries.
    - **Prisma**: The code is more readable and maintainable, allowing you to easily understand and modify queries.
4. Type Safety
    - **SQL**: Type safety is not enforced unless you implement it in your application logic.
    - **Prisma**: If you're using TypeScript, Prisma provides type definitions based on your schema, helping you catch errors at compile time.  "Need to see more of it."
5. Error Handling
    - **SQL**: Error handling is typically done through catching exceptions from query execution.
    - **Prisma**: Uses Promises and async/await syntax, making it easier to handle errors with try/catch blocks.
6. Migration Management
    - **SQL**: Migrations are often manual and can vary between different database systems.
    - **Prisma**: Comes with its own migration system, making schema changes easier to manage and apply consistently across environments.
7. Performance Considerations
    - Both methods have their own performance considerations, but Prisma optimizes many operations behind the scenes, although it can sometimes add overhead compared to raw SQL in high-performance scenarios.


- **Data Abstraction**
ORMs provide a unified API to interact with different databases, making it easier to switch databases if needed without rewriting your data access layer.
```jsx
    datasource db {
        provider = "postgresql"
        url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }
```

- **Type Safety/Auto-completion**
Modern ORMs, especially those used in statically typed languages or with TypeScript support, offer type safety and auto-completion, reducing runtime errors and improving developer productivity.

- **Automatic Migrations**
    - ORMs can automate the process of generating and applying database schema migrations, making it easier to evolve your database schema as your application grows.
    - Prisma Migrate generates SQL migration files for your schema changes, which can be applied to update the database schema.
    - "npx prisma migrate dev --name add_phone_number"
    - Applying migrations is handled by Prisma Migrate when you run the above command, keeping your database schema in sync with your Prisma schema.


### Installing prisma in a fresh app
- Initialize an empty Node.js project
"npm init -y"
- Add dependencies
"npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev"
- Initialize typescript
"npx tsc --init"
- In typescript.config file Change `rootDit` to `src` and Change `outDir` to `dist`
- Initialize a fresh prisma project
"npx prisma init"


>
REMEMBER
For bootstraping the prisma for fist, you need to run "npx prisma init"
once youve created schema.prisma file you need to run 2 commands
one to migrate the database, two to create the client, these are the two thing you always have to do.
"npx prisma migrate dev --name (name you wanted to give to migrate)"
a client
"npx prisma generate"nd then to generate


the process of converting the schema.prisma into the client is whats called auto generated client, and npx prisma generate
is the command you have to run for it.**

1. **Data Model**
Prisma uses a Prisma Schema file to define the data model of your application.
Eg:
```jsx
    // schema.prisma

    datasource db {
        provider = "postgresql"
        url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model User {
        id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
        name      String
        email     String   @unique
        posts     Post[]
    }

    model Post {
        id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
        title     String
        content   String?
        author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
        authorId  Int
    }
```

2. **Automated Migrations**
"`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`"
This command generates SQL migration files for the current state of your Prisma schema and applies them to your database, creating or altering tables and relationships as defined.

3. **Type Safety**
Prisma Client is a type-safe database client generated based on your Prisma schema. This means that every database query you write is checked against the schema, significantly reducing the risk of runtime errors due to data type mismatches.

4. **Auto Complete**
Prisma's integration with code editors (such as VSCode) provides auto-completion for model fields, operations, and even potential query results.




### Defining Model
Defining your data model in Prisma involves specifying the structure of your database tables and their relationships directly in the `schema.prisma` file. This schema acts as a blueprint for your database, allowing Prisma to generate the necessary code to interact with your data in a type-safe manner.

- Each `model` keyword defines a table in your database.
- The fields within each model represent columns in the table.
- Attributes like `@id`, `@default(autoincrement())`, and `@unique` specify column constraints and behaviors.
- After defining your data model, the next step is to generate migrations to create these tables in your database.
- After running the migrations, you can find them in the prisma/migrations folder in your project directory.
- A `migration.sql` file containing the SQL commands that were run against your database.
- A `README.md` file with information about the migration.


>
By defining your data model in the schema.prisma file and using Prisma Migrate, you've successfully created a Users and a Todos table in your database without manually writing any SQL.

### Exploring Your Database
- Connect to Your Database: Open your terminal and use the psql command to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Replace localhost, postgres, and postgres with your database's host, database name, and user, respectively, if they are different.
    - "psql -h localhost -d postgres -U postgres"
- Once connected, you can list all the tables in your database using the "\dt" command.
- To get detailed information about the structure of a specific table. For example, to describe the User table:
    - \\d "User"
- Query Data: You can also execute SQL queries directly.
    - "SELECT * FROM "User";"
- Exit psql by typing \\q and pressing Enter.

>
    Using psql to explore your database gives you a direct view of the underlying structure and data. It's a powerful tool for database administration and can be particularly useful for verifying the results of ORM operations, such as those performed by Prisma. Whether you're developing, debugging, or simply curious about the state of your database, psql provides the necessary commands to interact with and inspect your PostgreSQL database effectively.

## Prisma Client

```jsx
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "harkirat@gmail.com",
  },
});
```

Under the hood, Prisma Client converts this operation into an SQL query similar to:

```jsx
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('harkirat@gmail.com');
```

### How to Generate the Prisma Client?
After defining your data model in the schema.prisma file, you can generate the Prisma Client by running the following command in your terminal:
    "`npx prisma generate`"

### Using the Generated Prisma Client
Once generated, you can import and use the Prisma Client in your Node.js application to perform database operations.
Eg: for inserting/ creating user...
```jsx
    import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

    const prisma = new PrismaClient();

    async function main() {
        const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
            data: {
                email: "harkirat@gmail.com",
            },
        });
    }
    main();
```

- prisma.user.create() is a method provided by the Prisma Client to create (or insert) a new record in the user table. The method takes an object with a data property, which itself is an object containing the fields to be inserted into the table.

The Prisma Client provides similar methods for other CRUD operations and supports complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and joining data across tables.

Eg: for updating a user...
```jsx
    const res = await prisma.user.update({
        where: { username },
        data: {
            firstName,
            lastName
        }
    });
```


Eg: to get user's details...
```jsx
    async function getUser(username: string) {
        const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
            where: {
                username: username
            }
        });
    }
```
