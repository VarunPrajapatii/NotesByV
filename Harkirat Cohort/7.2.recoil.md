# Context API & Recoil

In React and other frontend frameworks, there are various methods to manage state:

1. **Local Component State:**
    - Each component in React can have its own local state managed using the `useState` hook.
    - Local state is confined to the component it belongs to and is primarily used for managing component-specific data.
2. **Context API:**
    - React provides the Context API to manage global state that needs to be accessed by multiple components.
    - It allows the sharing of state across the component tree without having to pass props manually through each level.
3. **State Management Libraries (e.g., Redux, Recoil):**
    - Specialized state management libraries offer advanced features for handling complex global state in large applications.
    - These libraries often introduce concepts like actions, reducers, and a centralized store for maintaining state.
4. **Recoil:**
    - Recoil is a state management library developed by Facebook specifically for React applications.
    - It introduces the concept of atoms and selectors, providing a more flexible and scalable approach to managing and sharing state.


The choice of state management method depends on the complexity and requirements of the application. Effective state management enhances the predictability, maintainability, and scalability of the application, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.




# RECOIL
RecoilRoot, atom, useRecoilState, useRecoilValue, useSetRecoilState, selector
Make folder store in that folder atoms and in that all the atoms you need to define.
Now you have to a define an atom, its like a variable/state variable. It takes an object as input in which you have to pass a key(which should uniquely identify an atom) and a initial value/default value. We have to wrap components in RecoilRoot such that we can use recoil in those wrapped components...

```js
{
    import { atom } from "recoil";

    export const countAtom = atom({
        key: "countAtom",
        default: 0
    });
}
```
useRecoilState its like useState it gives you two things, one the current value and one to update the value. useRecoilValue, it gives just the value. useSetRecoilState, if you only want to update the value you use this. 

In Recoil, selectors are used to derive state from atoms or other selectors. Think of a selector as a pure function that takes state from one or more atoms (or other selectors) and computes some new value based on that state. This makes selectors useful for calculating values or transforming state without storing extra data.
In a selector, you provide a getter function (via the get key), which tells Recoil how to fetch the current value of the selector. This getter function receives a special object that gives access to atoms or other selectors.


```js
{
    import { selector } from "recoil";
    
    export const evenSelector = selector({
        key: "evenSelector",
        get: ({get}) => {
            const count = get(countAtom);
            return count % 2;
        }
    })
}
```


default value cant be asynchronous but it can have a selector that’s asynchronous. What we can do is define a selector that fetches the values from the backend and in that selector we write the async logic there.


Practical example of selector:

```js
{
    import { atom } from 'recoil';
    import { selector } from 'recoil';
    import { cartAtom } from './atoms';

    export const cartAtom = atom({
        key: 'cartAtom', 
        default: [10, 15, 20], // Assume prices of 3 items
    });


    export const totalPriceSelector = selector({
        key: 'totalPriceSelector',
        get: ({ get }) => {
            const prices = get(cartAtom);     // Access the cartAtom
            return prices.reduce((total, price) => total + price, 0);  // Sum of prices
        },
    });
}
```




atomFamily: 
sometime you need more than one atom for your usecase. Lets say we have a todo application and we want to store todo on atom. For every todo it has unique id, and you have to have different atom for different todos. Also you cant create an array of todos in a single atom its downside is if one todo changes it all of these rerenders. Here you have to make atomFamily for this. Each component needs to create its new atom. So rather subscribing to the atom, you subscribe to the atomFamily. You give that atomFamily the id and it will give the todo atom for that id todo. 

selectorFamily:
When you have an atom you can use a selector in its default value which makes async function. But in atomFamiy default, you need to make selectorFamily to make async call. 

useRecoilStateLoadable:
To show the loader until the data fetched and shown on frontend, we can use Suspense api which we have seen. Or in this, rather than using useRecoilState to get the atom/selector, we can use useRecoilStateLoadable .
Now rather than using useRecoilState you can use useRecoilStateLoadable. So the problem is as useRecoilState returns an array of variable and a setvariable, the useRecoilStateLoadable the variable it returns is an object which has a set of few things, contents where the actual data is there. And there is state which has one of 3 values “hasValue”, “hasError”, “loading”.
