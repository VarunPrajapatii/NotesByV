# Recoil

- Recoil is a state management library developed by Facebook specifically for React applications.
- It introduces the concept of atoms and selectors, providing a more flexible and scalable approach to managing and sharing state.

- Recoil has a concept of atom to store state. An atom can be defined outside the component and can be teleported to any component. Defining atom is like useState. 
- We have to wrap components in RecoilRoot such that we can use recoil in those wrapped components...
- To a define an atom, its like a variable. It takes an object as input in which you have to pass a key(which should uniquely identify an atom) and default, which has an initial value/default value.
- As we make a state variable, we have the variable and a set function. Just like this you need to get comfortable with the these 3 apis: useRecoilState, useRecoilValue, useSetRecoilState. 
- useRecoilState its like useState it gives you two things, one the current value and one to update the value. useRecoilValue, it gives just the value. useSetRecoilState, if you only want to update the value you use this.
```js
    import { atom } from "recoil";

    export const countAtom = atom({
        key: "countAtom",
        default: 0
    })
```
- Selectors : Just like we use useMemo, if a rerender happen and the variable passed in the dependency array [] haven’t changed then it wont run that function passed in useMemo. Silimarly we can define a selector, when we know that something completely depends on a variable. 
- A selector represents a piece of derived state. 
    - You can use it to transform, compute, or derive new values from the existing atoms or other selectors without storing them explicitly. Instead of calculating values in multiple components, selectors let you compute derived state in a single place.
    - Selectors are pure functions that depend on other state (atoms or selectors) and automatically re-evaluate whenever their dependencies change. 
    - Just Like we defined an atom we give it a key and default value but in selector we don’t give it a default value, you give it a get key, thats how recoil get the current value of the selector. And when you define that function, you get access to the `get` value in the prop object, in that you get the set of atoms or selectors. Then in that callback function you define the logic. 
```js
    import { selector } from "recoil";
    import { countAtom } from "../atoms/count";

    export const evenSelector = selector({
        key: "evenSelector",
        get: (props) => {
            const count = props.get(countAtom);
            return count % 2;
        }
    })
```
**Writable Selectors:**
Selectors can also be writable by defining a `set` function. This lets you update dependent atoms through the selector.
```js
export const writableCounterSelector = selector({
  key: 'writableCounterSelector',
  get: ({ get }) => {
    return get(counterAtom);
  },
  set: ({ set }, newValue) => {
    set(counterAtom, newValue); // Update the counterAtom directly
  },
});

//Using it in a component
function WritableCounter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useRecoilState(writableCounterSelector);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {counter}</h1>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={counter}
        onChange={(e) => setCounter(Number(e.target.value))}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

```

**ASYNCHRONOUS DATA QUERIES:** 
#### **Problem: Flashing Default Values**
Now a linkedin notifications bar has the notification counts for feed, connections, notifications etc. and in that the count values are coming dynamically from the backend. 
What we can do is set default value to the buttons as 0 and then fetch using useEffect and then update the atoms. 
But in this approach 0 can be seen for a bit(i.e. when the render happens the values are 0 and when we get values from the backend we populate them with that until for a bit we see 0). React suspends the rendering until the async selector resolves. To address this, use Suspense to provide fallback ui.
When dynamically fetching data (e.g., notification counts from a backend), setting default values like `0` can cause a brief "flash" of incorrect values before the actual data loads.

#### **Approach 1: Using `useEffect`**
- Initialize the state with `0`.
- Fetch data using `useEffect` and update the atom.
- **Con**: Flashing of "0" is visible.

#### **Approach 2: Async Default Selector**
Define a Recoil atom with an asynchronous selector in the `default` property to fetch data:

```js
export const notifications = atom({
    key: "networkAtom",
    default: selector({
        key: "networkAtomSelector",
        get: async () => {
            try {
                const res = await axios.get("http://linkedin.varuntd.com/api/v1/network/count");
                return res.data;
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Failed to fetch notifications:", error);
                return { feed: 0, connections: 0, messages: 0 }; // Default fallback
            }
        },
    }),
});
```


**Recoil Advanced Concepts and Examples:**
Recoil provides powerful tools for managing state in React applications. Some of its advanced features, like atomFamily, selectorFamily, and useRecoilStateLoadable, address common challenges in state management and improve performance and scalability. Here's a detailed breakdown of these concepts:

1. **atomFamily**
Sometimes, a single atom isn't enough. For instance, in a Todo application, you might want a separate state for each Todo item identified by a unique ID. Storing all Todos in one atom can cause performance issues, as changes to a single Todo will trigger re-renders for all items.
An atomFamily solves this by dynamically creating individual atoms for each unique ID. Instead of subscribing to one atom, components subscribe to the atomFamily and access specific atoms by providing an ID.

eg. Todo Application
```js
import { atomFamily } from "recoil";

// Create an atomFamily for Todos
export const todoAtomFamily = atomFamily({
    key: "todoAtomFamily",
    default: {
        text: "",
        completed: false,
    },
});
```
Using atomFamily in Components:
```jsx
import { useRecoilState } from "recoil";
import { todoAtomFamily } from "./state";

function TodoItem({ id }) {
    const [todo, setTodo] = useRecoilState(todoAtomFamily(id));

    const toggleCompleted = () => {
        setTodo((prev) => ({ ...prev, completed: !prev.completed }));
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{todo.text}</p>
            <button onClick={toggleCompleted}>
                {todo.completed ? "Mark Incomplete" : "Mark Complete"}
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

2. **selectorFamily**
While a selector can derive or fetch data for an atom, using selectorFamily allows you to create parameterized selectors. This is especially useful for asynchronous operations where each atom in an atomFamily might require a unique default value, such as data fetched from a backend.

Example: Async Fetching in a Todo App
Here’s how you can fetch data for each Todo dynamically using selectorFamily:
```js
import { atomFamily, selectorFamily } from "recoil";
import axios from "axios";

// Define an atomFamily for Todos
export const todoAtomFamily = atomFamily({
    key: "todoAtomFamily",
    default: selectorFamily({
        key: "todoSelectorFamily",
        get: (id) => async () => {
            await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000)); // Simulate delay
            const response = await axios.get(
                `http://linkedin.varuntd.com/api/v1/todos/${id}`
            );
            return response.data.todo;
        },
    }),
});
```
Usage in Components:
```jsx
import { useRecoilValue } from "recoil";
import { todoAtomFamily } from "./state";

function TodoItem({ id }) {
    const todo = useRecoilValue(todoAtomFamily(id)); // Automatically fetches data

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{todo.text}</p>
            <p>Status: {todo.completed ? "Completed" : "Pending"}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```
3. **useRecoilStateLoadable**
To handle loading states, errors, or fetched data more effectively, you can use useRecoilStateLoadable. Unlike useRecoilState, which directly returns the state and a setter, useRecoilStateLoadable returns an object with:

state: Indicates the status ("hasValue", "loading", or "hasError").
contents: The actual data.
This is particularly useful when working with async selectors and needing precise control over loading states.

eg. Loader for Async Fetching
```js
import { useRecoilValueLoadable } from "recoil";
import { todoAtomFamily } from "./state";

function TodoItemWithLoader({ id }) {
    const loadable = useRecoilValueLoadable(todoAtomFamily(id));

    if (loadable.state === "loading") {
        return <p>Loading...</p>;
    }

    if (loadable.state === "hasError") {
        return <p>Error loading Todo!</p>;
    }

    const todo = loadable.contents;
    return (
        <div>
            <p>{todo.text}</p>
            <p>Status: {todo.completed ? "Completed" : "Pending"}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```
Recoil Basics Recap
Before diving into advanced features, let’s revisit Recoil’s core concepts:

Atoms: The basic unit of state. Think of them as independent state variables.
```js
import { atom } from "recoil";

export const countAtom = atom({
    key: "countAtom",
    default: 0,
});
```
Selectors: Used to derive state or compute values based on atoms.
```js
import { selector } from "recoil";

export const evenSelector = selector({
    key: "evenSelector",
    get: ({ get }) => {
        const count = get(countAtom);
        return count % 2 === 0;
    },
});
```
useRecoilState: Similar to useState, provides both state and a setter.

useRecoilValue: Retrieves only the state value.

useSetRecoilState: Updates state without reading it.

Additional Examples
Selector for Derived State (Cart Example):
```js
import { atom, selector } from "recoil";

export const cartAtom = atom({
    key: "cartAtom",
    default: [10, 15, 20], // Item prices
});

export const totalPriceSelector = selector({
    key: "totalPriceSelector",
    get: ({ get }) => {
        const prices = get(cartAtom);
        return prices.reduce((total, price) => total + price, 0);
    },
});
```
Usage:
```jsx
import { useRecoilValue } from "recoil";
import { totalPriceSelector } from "./state";

function CartTotal() {
    const totalPrice = useRecoilValue(totalPriceSelector);

    return <p>Total Price: {totalPrice}</p>;
}
```
Key Takeaways:
- Use atomFamily for dynamic atom creation (e.g., per Todo item).
- Use selectorFamily for parameterized selectors (e.g., fetching data per ID).
- Use useRecoilStateLoadable for precise control over async states, especially for loaders.
