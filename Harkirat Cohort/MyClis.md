Got it — you have a rich setup with multiple terminals and environments, and it's causing confusion about when and where to do what. Let me break down your tools, their best uses, and suggest a streamlined workflow so you can **focus on your work without getting tangled**.

# Your Current Setup — Summary & Best Use Cases

| Tool/Environment              | Description                               | Best For                                                                     | Notes                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PowerShell**                | Windows shell, default in VS Code         | Windows-native commands, scripting, Git (works fine)                         | Great for quick Windows stuff, VS Code default, but less Linux-like  |
| **Git Bash (Hyper Terminal)** | Bash shell for Windows with Unix commands | Git, basic bash scripting, simple Docker commands                            | Lightweight, but limited Linux features (no sudo, no apt)            |
| **Alacritty**                 | Terminal emulator (runs any shell)        | Preferred terminal UI — you can run any shell inside                         | Just a window; shell inside is what matters (PowerShell, WSL, etc.)  |
| **Ubuntu (WSL)**              | Full Linux environment inside Windows     | Linux-native tools, apt package management, AWS CLI, Docker, Linux scripting | Use for any Linux-specific work, AWS CLI install, real Linux dev     |
| **VS Code Terminal**          | Integrated terminal (usually PowerShell)  | Convenient for editing + running shell commands                              | You can change shell inside VS Code to WSL/bash/PowerShell           |
| **Docker Desktop**            | Docker on Windows, uses WSL internally    | Docker container management and running                                      | Access Docker CLI anywhere once Docker Desktop is installed          |
| **EC2 (via SSH)**             | Remote Linux server                       | Deployment, server maintenance, running apps                                 | Connect from any terminal supporting ssh (Hyper, Alacritty, VS Code) |

# Your Current Use Pattern and How to Simplify It

### What you do now:

* Use **PowerShell** in VS Code terminal for most commands including `ls`, `cd`, `git commit/push`.
* Use **Hyper Terminal (Git Bash)** for Docker commands and some Linux commands.
* Use **Alacritty** sometimes to access EC2 servers.
* Installing AWS CLI (planning to use inside WSL Ubuntu).
* Using EC2 SSH connections from Hyper and Alacritty.

### Problems:

* Multiple terminals, multiple environments, sometimes overlapping commands.
* Some commands behave differently (e.g., `sudo` missing in Git Bash, Windows paths in PowerShell).
* Confusion over where to install tools (AWS CLI, Docker CLI).
* Switching context is annoying.

---

# Recommended Simplified Workflow

---

## 1. **Make WSL Ubuntu Your Primary Dev Environment**

**Why?**
It gives you a *real Linux environment* inside Windows — perfect for AWS CLI, Docker CLI, Linux-native tools, bash scripts, and a close match to your EC2 servers.

**Action:**

* Use Ubuntu WSL as your **main terminal for all Linux-related work**:

  * Install AWS CLI inside WSL Ubuntu.
  * Use WSL Ubuntu to run Docker commands (Docker Desktop integrates with WSL).
  * Run `git`, `vim`, `ls`, `cd`, `ssh`, etc., natively.

* You can open WSL Ubuntu in:

  * Standalone terminal (Windows Terminal or Alacritty configured with WSL).
  * Inside VS Code by changing the default integrated terminal to WSL.

---

## 2. **Use PowerShell for Windows-specific tasks**

**When?**

* When you need to run Windows-native commands or tools.
* When you want to use Windows GUI tools alongside (e.g., open files, run Windows apps).
* When your dev flow needs Windows tools (e.g., `code` CLI).

**How?**

* Keep PowerShell as default terminal in VS Code only if you prefer.
* You can switch to WSL shell inside VS Code easily (explained below).

---

## 3. **Use VS Code with WSL Integration**

**Setup:**

* Install the **Remote - WSL** extension in VS Code.
* Open your project folder **from inside WSL Ubuntu** (either open Ubuntu terminal and run `code .` or open from VS Code Remote Explorer).
* VS Code will then:

  * Use the WSL environment for terminal.
  * Use Linux versions of tools.
  * Avoid path confusion between Windows and Linux.

---

## 4. **Docker Commands Inside WSL**

* Docker Desktop for Windows supports **WSL2 integration**.
* You can run all Docker commands inside your **WSL Ubuntu terminal** directly.
* No need to switch to Git Bash or Hyper just for Docker.

---

## 5. **EC2 SSH from WSL or VS Code**

* Use `ssh` from WSL Ubuntu terminal or VS Code terminal (set to WSL).
* Alternatively, VS Code has a **Remote - SSH extension** that lets you connect and develop on EC2 directly.

---

## 6. **AWS CLI Installation**

* Install AWS CLI **inside WSL Ubuntu** for the smoothest experience.
* Then, use it in Ubuntu shell for:

  * Deploying frontend to S3
  * Managing AWS resources
  * Writing automation scripts

---

# How to Set This Up In VS Code (Terminal & Remote)

### Change VS Code integrated terminal to WSL:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for **Terminal › Integrated › Shell: Windows**
3. Set it to:

   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\wsl.exe
   ```
4. Open a new terminal — it will open your Ubuntu WSL shell.

### Install Remote - WSL Extension

* Search for **Remote - WSL** in Extensions tab
* Install it
* Open folder in WSL (File > Open Folder > select your WSL filesystem)

# Summary: Your Simplified Workflow

| Task                                       | Where To Do It                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| General Linux commands (`ls`, `cd`, `vim`) | WSL Ubuntu terminal / VS Code terminal (set to WSL) |
| Git commit, push, pull                     | WSL Ubuntu terminal / VS Code terminal (WSL)        |
| Docker commands                            | WSL Ubuntu terminal                                 |
| AWS CLI commands, deployment               | WSL Ubuntu terminal                                 |
| EC2 SSH                                    | WSL Ubuntu terminal or VS Code Remote SSH           |
| Windows-native commands                    | PowerShell terminal (VS Code or standalone)         |

# Final Notes

* You can keep **Alacritty and Hyper** for preference and speed — just configure them to run WSL by default if you want consistency.
* Avoid mixing environments too much — try to do **Linux and AWS stuff exclusively in WSL Ubuntu**.
* Keep PowerShell for Windows-specific workflows only.
* VS Code is your unified editor + terminal, with WSL integration, to make things smooth.
