# Document Object Model


### DOM
JavaScript and the browser communicate through a set of tools in this magical interface known as the DOM. These tools include properties, methods, and events. It's like having a language to tell your browser what to do and when to do it. 
In JavaScript, you use commands to grab elements from your HTML page, change their content, or even create new elements. It's like giving instructions to your browser using JavaScript.

#### Possibilities of DOM
- Change the content of your webpage dynamically.
- Update styles and layout on the fly.
- Respond to user interactions, like clicks or keyboard inputs.
- Add or remove elements, making your page super interactive.

### DOM Tree
The DOM tree is a hierarchical representation of the structure of a web documents in the context of web development. It's essentially a way to organize and navigate the elements of an HTML or XML document.
- **Document Object:** At the top of the tree is the Document Object, representing the entire web document.
- **HTML Element:** The HTML element comes next, serving as the container for the entire document.
- **Head and Body Elements:** Within the HTML element, there are two main sections: the Head and the Body. The Head typically contains meta-information, styles, and links to external resources, while the Body holds the primary content visible on the webpage.
- **Further Nesting:** Each of these main sections may contain further nested elements. For instance, the Head could include elements like title, meta, or link, while the Body could include paragraphs, images, buttons, and other content-related elements.


### Difference Between HTMLCollection and NodeList:

Both HTMLCollections and NodeLists are collections of nodes in the Document Object Model (DOM) provided by JavaScript, but they have some key differences:

#### HTMLCollection:

1. **Live Collection:**
    - **Live:** An HTMLCollection is live, meaning it is automatically updated when the underlying document changes. If elements are added or removed, the HTMLCollection is automatically updated to reflect these changes.
2. **Accessing Elements:**
    - **By Index:** Elements in an HTMLCollection can be accessed using numerical indices, similar to an array.
3. **Methods:**
    - **Limited Methods:** HTMLCollections have a more limited set of methods compared to NodeLists.
4. **Specific to Elements:**
    - **Element-Specific:** HTMLCollections are typically used for collections of HTML elements, such as those returned by `getElementsByTagName` or `getElementsByClassName`.

#### NodeList:

1. **Live or Static:**
    - **Live or Static:** A NodeList can be live or static. If it's obtained using `querySelectorAll`, it's static and won't automatically update. If it's obtained by other means, like `childNodes`, it might be live.
2. **Accessing Elements:**
    - **By Index or forEach:** Like HTMLCollection, you can access elements by index. Additionally, NodeList supports the `forEach` method for iteration.
3. **Methods:**
    - **Richer Set of Methods:** NodeLists typically have a broader set of methods compared to HTMLCollections.
4. **Not Limited to Elements:**
    - **Node-Oriented:** NodeLists can include various types of nodes, not just HTML elements. They might include text nodes, comment nodes, etc.

#### Practical Considerations:

- **Common Methods:**
    - For general purpose, when using methods like `querySelectorAll`, you will get a NodeList.
- **Live vs. Static:**
    - If you need a live collection that automatically updates, an HTMLCollection might be suitable.
    - If you want a static collection that won't change, or if you need a broader range of methods, a NodeList might be preferable.
- **Usage:**
    - HTMLCollections are often associated with specific methods like `getElementsByClassName` or `getElementsByTagName`.
    - NodeLists are often the result of more generic methods like `querySelectorAll` or properties like `childNodes`.

In summary, the choice between HTMLCollection and NodeList depends on your specific needs, especially regarding the liveliness of the collection and the methods you require for manipulation.



### Query Selectors

Query Selectors allows developers to select and manipulate HTML elements in a document using CSS-like syntax. They provide a powerful and flexible way to target specific elements based on various criteria, such as element type, class, ID, or attribute.

Here are some common examples of using Query Selectors:

- **Selecting by Element Type:**
    
    ```jsx
    var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');
    ```
    
- **Selecting by Class Name:**
    
    ```jsx
    var elementsWithClass = document.querySelectorAll('.className');
    ```
    
- **Selecting by ID:**
    
    ```jsx
    var elementWithId = document.querySelector('#elementId');
    ```
    
- **Selecting by Attribute:**
    
    ```jsx
    var elementsWithAttribute = document.querySelectorAll('[data-custom]');
    ```
    
- **Combining Selectors:**
    
    ```jsx
    var complexSelection = document.querySelectorAll('ul li.active');
    ```


### DOM Node
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document. A DOM Node is a fundamental interface in the DOM hierarchy, representing a generic node in the tree structure. All elements, attributes, and text content in an HTML or XML document are nodes.



## DOM Events
DOM events are interactions or occurrences that take place in a web page, such as a user clicking a button, pressing a key, resizing the browser window, or the content of an input field changing.

#### Reacting to Events:

Inline Event Handlers:
You can define event handlers directly within HTML elements using inline attributes like onclick, onmouseover, etc.
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>
​
DOM Level 0 Event Handling:
You can assign event handlers directly to JavaScript properties of DOM elements.
    var button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    button.onclick = function() {
        // Handle the click event
    };
    ​
DOM Level 2 Event Handling:
The addEventListener method is used to attach event handlers to elements. This method provides more flexibility and allows multiple handlers for the same event.
    var button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        // Handle the click event
    });
​
Event Object:
Event handlers typically receive an event object that provides information about the event, such as the target element, mouse coordinates, key codes, etc.
    button.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        console.log("Button clicked!", event.target);
    });


#### Common Events:

1. **Click Event:**
    - Triggered when a mouse button is clicked.
2. **Keydown and Keyup Events:**
    - Fired when a key on the keyboard is pressed or released.
3. **Submit Event:**
    - Triggered when a form is submitted.
4. **Change Event:**
    - Fired when the value of an input field changes.
5. **Load Event:**
    - Occurs when a resource (like an image or script) and the entire page have finished loading.




The `onload` and `onunload` events are part of the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) and are used to execute JavaScript code when a document or a page finishes loading (`onload`) or unloading (`onunload`). These events are commonly used to perform actions when a user enters or leaves a webpage.

#### `onload` Event:

The `onload` event is triggered when a document or a webpage has finished loading. This event is often used to ensure that all resources, such as images and scripts, have been fully loaded before executing specific JavaScript code.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>onload Event Example</title>
    <script>
        window.onload = function() {
            // Code to execute after the page has fully loaded
            alert("Page loaded!");
        };
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

```

In this example, the `onload` event is used to display an alert when the page has finished loading.

#### `onunload` Event:

The `onunload` event is triggered just before a document or a webpage is about to be unloaded, such as when the user navigates away from the page or closes the browser tab. This event is often used to perform cleanup tasks or prompt the user for confirmation before leaving the page.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>onunload Event Example</title>
    <script>
        window.onunload = function() {
            // Code to execute before the page is unloaded
            alert("Goodbye! Come back soon.");
        };
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Thanks for visiting!</h1>
</body>
</html>

```

In this example, the `onunload` event is used to display an alert just before the page is unloaded.

These events play a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of a web page and allow developers to execute code at specific points during the page's existence.



#### DOM Event Listeners
DOM Event Listeners provide a more flexible and powerful way to handle events compared to traditional event attributes (e.g., `onclick`). Event Listeners allow you to attach multiple event handlers to a single event, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

##### Using `addEventListener`:

The `addEventListener` method is used to attach an event listener to an HTML element. It takes three parameters: the event type, the function to be executed when the event occurs, and an optional third parameter indicating whether the event should be captured during the event propagation phase.

##### Syntax:

```jsx
element.addEventListener(eventType, eventHandler, useCapture);

```

- **`eventType`**: A string representing the type of event (e.g., "click", "keydown", "change").
- **`eventHandler`**: A function that will be called when the event occurs.
- **`useCapture`**: (Optional) A boolean value indicating whether to use the capturing phase (`true`) or the bubbling phase (`false`, default).




### Event Bubbling & Event Capturing

Event bubbling and event capturing are two phases of event propagation in the HTML DOM. When an event occurs on an HTML element, it goes through these two phases:

1. **Event Capturing (Capture Phase):**
    - In this phase, the event travels from the root of the DOM tree to the target element.
    - Event handlers attached with `useCapture` set to `true` are triggered during this phase.
2. **Event Bubbling (Bubbling Phase):**
    - In this phase, the event travels from the target element back up to the root of the DOM tree.
    - Event handlers attached without specifying `useCapture` or with `useCapture` set to `false` are triggered during this phase.

#### Example of Event Capturing:

In the following example, we have a nested set of div elements, and we attach event listeners to the document capturing phase (`useCapture` set to `true`). When you click on the innermost div, you'll see that the event handlers for the capturing phase are triggered from the root to the target:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Event Capturing Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <div id="outer" style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
        Outer
        <div id="middle" style="border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;">
            Middle
            <div id="inner" style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 10px;">
                Inner
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("outer").addEventListener("click", function() {
            console.log("Outer Capturing");
        }, true);

        document.getElementById("middle").addEventListener("click", function() {
            console.log("Middle Capturing");
        }, true);

        document.getElementById("inner").addEventListener("click", function() {
            console.log("Inner Capturing");
        }, true);
    </script>

</body>
</html>
```

When you click on the "Inner" div, you'll see in the console that the capturing phase event handlers are triggered in the order: Outer Capturing, Middle Capturing, Inner Capturing.

#### Example of Event Bubbling:

In this example, event listeners are attached without specifying `useCapture` or with `useCapture` set to `false`. When you click on the innermost div, the event handlers are triggered in the bubbling phase from the target back up to the root:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Event Bubbling Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <div id="outer" style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
        Outer
        <div id="middle" style="border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;">
            Middle
            <div id="inner" style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 10px;">
                Inner
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("outer").addEventListener("click", function() {
            console.log("Outer Bubbling");
        });

        document.getElementById("middle").addEventListener("click", function() {
            console.log("Middle Bubbling");
        });

        document.getElementById("inner").addEventListener("click", function() {
            console.log("Inner Bubbling");
        });
    </script>

</body>
</html>
```

When you click on the "Inner" div, you'll see in the console that the bubbling phase event handlers are triggered in the order: Inner Bubbling, Middle Bubbling, Outer Bubbling.

In practice, event bubbling is more commonly used, and the `useCapture` parameter is often omitted or set to `false` when attaching event listeners. Event capturing is less commonly used and is mainly applicable in specific scenarios where capturing is explicitly needed.
