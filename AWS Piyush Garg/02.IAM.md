# IAM Service in AWS
So we have 2 types of accounts login, Root User and IAM User

**Root User** - Account Owner, top level admin
**IAM User** - Team Members, SubAccounts etc can login with IAM User


So its said that, all the critical/developement tasks we shouldnt do with root user, as it has all the access so by mistake can be done something that can create the bill. We should only manage the account like billing, iam, users. So Root account should only be used for management.
Regions are where the physical data centres of aws are localted.

In the IAM page, you can see your account id or account alias. When IAM user login then they have to enter that too.
In IAM access management you can see Users, in there you can add IAM users for your team. 
There are two type of user accessing the aws service, one is programmatic way and other is through aws console.
You create user, then you login as IAM user. So from your root account you can set, delete, change IAM user service access permissions.
When you have many user and they users should have many permissions (max 10 permission policies can be attached to a IAM user), you can make a group and we can attach permissions and the users in that group will have all the permissions attached to that group. You can add user to more than one group too.
We can make our own custom policies, which is highly highly customizable.
